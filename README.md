# About:

In this repository, you will find several machine-learning projects that I have worked on.

# Table of Contents:

1. [Rusted Roof Detection](rusted_roof_detection): A computer vision model to identify roofs corroded with rust.
2. [Audio Emotion Detector](audio_emotion_detector): A computer vision model adapted to recognize several emotions from the sound.
3. [Federalist Paper Authorship](federalist_paper_authorship): Microsoft's transformer model, Deberta, fine-tuned to determine the author of disputed federalist papers.
4. [Machine Learning Algorithms From Scratch](From%20Scratch%20Implementation): Several machine learning algorithms often built from scratch. 
5. [Is-sem AI-powered Career Guidance](is_sem_job_assistance): A full-stack web application offering support in career exploration.
