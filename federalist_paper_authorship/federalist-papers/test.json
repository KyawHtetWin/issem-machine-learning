        "content": "The Same Subject Continued(The Total Number of the House of\n\nRepresentatives)\n\nFrom the New York Packet. Tuesday, February 19, 1788.\n\nTo the People of the State of New York:\n\nTHE SECOND charge against the House of Representatives is, that\n\nit will be too small to possess a due knowledge of the interests\n\nof its constituents. As this objection evidently proceeds from a\n\ncomparison of the proposed number of representatives with the\n\ngreat extent of the United States, the number of their\n\ninhabitants, and the diversity of their interests, without taking\n\ninto view at the same time the circumstances which will\n\ndistinguish the Congress from other legislative bodies, the best\n\nanswer that can be given to it will be a brief explanation of\n\nthese peculiarities. It is a sound and important principle that\n\nthe representative ought to be acquainted with the interests and\n\ncircumstances of his constituents. But this principle can extend\n\nno further than to those circumstances and interests to which the\n\nauthority and care of the representative relate. An ignorance of\n\na variety of minute and particular objects, which do not lie\n\nwithin the compass of legislation, is consistent with every\n\nattribute necessary to a due performance of the legislative\n\ntrust. In determining the extent of information required in the\n\nexercise of a particular authority, recourse then must be had to\n\nthe objects within the purview of that authority. What are to be\n\nthe objects of federal legislation? Those which are of most\n\nimportance, and which seem most to require local knowledge, are\n\ncommerce, taxation, and the militia. A proper regulation of\n\ncommerce requires much information, as has been elsewhere\n\nremarked; but as far as this information relates to the laws and\n\nlocal situation of each individual State, a very few\n\nrepresentatives would be very sufficient vehicles of it to the\n\nfederal councils. Taxation will consist, in a great measure, of\n\nduties which will be involved in the regulation of commerce. So\n\nfar the preceding remark is applicable to this object. As far as\n\nit may consist of internal collections, a more diffusive\n\nknowledge of the circumstances of the State may be necessary. But\n\nwill not this also be possessed in sufficient degree by a very\n\nfew intelligent men, diffusively elected within the State? Divide\n\nthe largest State into ten or twelve districts, and it will be\n\nfound that there will be no peculiar local interests in either,\n\nwhich will not be within the knowledge of the representative of\n\nthe district. Besides this source of information, the laws of the\n\nState, framed by representatives from every part of it, will be\n\nalmost of themselves a sufficient guide. In every State there\n\nhave been made, and must continue to be made, regulations on this\n\nsubject which will, in many cases, leave little more to be done\n\nby the federal legislature, than to review the different laws,\n\nand reduce them in one general act. A skillful individual in his\n\ncloset with all the local codes before him, might compile a law\n\non some subjects of taxation for the whole union, without any aid\n\nfrom oral information, and it may be expected that whenever\n\ninternal taxes may be necessary, and particularly in cases\n\nrequiring uniformity throughout the States, the more simple\n\nobjects will be preferred. To be fully sensible of the facility\n\nwhich will be given to this branch of federal legislation by the\n\nassistance of the State codes, we need only suppose for a moment\n\nthat this or any other State were divided into a number of parts,\n\neach having and exercising within itself a power of local\n\nlegislation. Is it not evident that a degree of local information\n\nand preparatory labor would be found in the several volumes of\n\ntheir proceedings, which would very much shorten the labors of\n\nthe general legislature, and render a much smaller number of\n\nmembers sufficient for it? The federal councils will derive great\n\nadvantage from another circumstance. The representatives of each\n\nState will not only bring with them a considerable knowledge of\n\nits laws, and a local knowledge of their respective districts,\n\nbut will probably in all cases have been members, and may even at\n\nthe very time be members, of the State legislature, where all the\n\nlocal information and interests of the State are assembled, and\n\nfrom whence they may easily be conveyed by a very few hands into\n\nthe legislature of the United States. The observations made on\n\nthe subject of taxation apply with greater force to the case of\n\nthe militia. For however different the rules of discipline may be\n\nin different States, they are the same throughout each particular\n\nState; and depend on circumstances which can differ but little in\n\ndifferent parts of the same State. The attentive reader will\n\ndiscern that the reasoning here used, to prove the sufficiency of\n\na moderate number of representatives, does not in any respect\n\ncontradict what was urged on another occasion with regard to the\n\nextensive information which the representatives ought to possess,\n\nand the time that might be necessary for acquiring it. This\n\ninformation, so far as it may relate to local objects, is\n\nrendered necessary and difficult, not by a difference of laws and\n\nlocal circumstances within a single State, but of those among\n\ndifferent States. Taking each State by itself, its laws are the\n\nsame, and its interests but little diversified. A few men,\n\ntherefore, will possess all the knowledge requisite for a proper\n\nrepresentation of them. Were the interests and affairs of each\n\nindividual State perfectly simple and uniform, a knowledge of\n\nthem in one part would involve a knowledge of them in every\n\nother, and the whole State might be competently represented by a\n\nsingle member taken from any part of it. On a comparison of the\n\ndifferent States together, we find a great dissimilarity in their\n\nlaws, and in many other circumstances connected with the objects\n\nof federal legislation, with all of which the federal\n\nrepresentatives ought to have some acquaintance. Whilst a few\n\nrepresentatives, therefore, from each State, may bring with them\n\na due knowledge of their own State, every representative will\n\nhave much information to acquire concerning all the other States.\n\nThe changes of time, as was formerly remarked, on the comparative\n\nsituation of the different States, will have an assimilating\n\neffect. The effect of time on the internal affairs of the States,\n\ntaken singly, will be just the contrary. At present some of the\n\nStates are little more than a society of husbandmen. Few of them\n\nhave made much progress in those branches of industry which give\n\na variety and complexity to the affairs of a nation. These,\n\nhowever, will in all of them be the fruits of a more advanced\n\npopulation, and will require, on the part of each State, a fuller\n\nrepresentation. The foresight of the convention has accordingly\n\ntaken care that the progress of population may be accompanied\n\nwith a proper increase of the representative branch of the\n\ngovernment. The experience of Great Britain, which presents to\n\nmankind so many political lessons, both of the monitory and\n\nexemplary kind, and which has been frequently consulted in the\n\ncourse of these inquiries, corroborates the result of the\n\nreflections which we have just made. The number of inhabitants in\n\nthe two kingdoms of England and Scotland cannot be stated at less\n\nthan eight millions. The representatives of these eight millions\n\nin the House of Commons amount to five hundred and fifty-eight.\n\nOf this number, one ninth are elected by three hundred and\n\nsixty-four persons, and one half, by five thousand seven hundred\n\nand twenty-three persons. 1 It cannot be supposed that the half\n\nthus elected, and who do not even reside among the people at\n\nlarge, can add any thing either to the security of the people\n\nagainst the government, or to the knowledge of their\n\ncircumstances and interests in the legislative councils. On the\n\ncontrary, it is notorious, that they are more frequently the\n\nrepresentatives and instruments of the executive magistrate, than\n\nthe guardians and advocates of the popular rights. They might\n\ntherefore, with great propriety, be considered as something more\n\nthan a mere deduction from the real representatives of the\n\nnation. We will, however, consider them in this light alone, and\n\nwill not extend the deduction to a considerable number of\n\nothers, who do not reside among their constitutents, are very\n\nfaintly connected with them, and have very little particular\n\nknowledge of their affairs. With all these concessions, two\n\nhundred and seventy-nine persons only will be the depository of\n\nthe safety, interest, and happiness of eight millions that is to\n\nsay, there will be one representative only to maintain the rights\n\nand explain the situation OF TWENTY-EIGHT THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED\n\nAND SEVENTY constitutents, in an assembly exposed to the whole\n\nforce of executive influence, and extending its authority to\n\nevery object of legislation within a nation whose affairs are in\n\nthe highest degree diversified and complicated. Yet it is very\n\ncertain, not only that a valuable portion of freedom has been\n\npreserved under all these circumstances, but that the defects in\n\nthe British code are chargeable, in a very small proportion, on\n\nthe ignorance of the legislature concerning the circumstances of\n\nthe people. Allowing to this case the weight which is due to it,\n\nand comparing it with that of the House of Representatives as\n\nabove explained it seems to give the fullest assurance, that a\n\nrepresentative for every THIRTY THOUSAND INHABITANTS will render\n\nthe latter both a safe and competent guardian of the interests\n\nwhich will be confided to it.

        "content": "The House of Representatives\n\nFrom the New York Packet. Friday, February 8, 1788.\n\nTo the People of the State of New York:\n\nFROM the more general inquiries pursued in the four last papers,\n\nI pass on to a more particular examination of the several parts\n\nof the government. I shall begin with the House of\n\nRepresentatives. The first view to be taken of this part of the\n\ngovernment relates to the qualifications of the electors and the\n\nelected. Those of the former are to be the same with those of the\n\nelectors of the most numerous branch of the State legislatures.\n\nThe definition of the right of suffrage is very justly regarded\n\nas a fundamental article of republican government. It was\n\nincumbent on the convention, therefore, to define and establish\n\nthis right in the Constitution. To have left it open for the\n\noccasional regulation of the Congress, would have been improper\n\nfor the reason just mentioned. To have submitted it to the\n\nlegislative discretion of the States, would have been improper\n\nfor the same reason; and for the additional reason that it would\n\nhave rendered too dependent on the State governments that branch\n\nof the federal government which ought to be dependent on the\n\npeople alone. To have reduced the different qualifications in the\n\ndifferent States to one uniform rule, would probably have been as\n\ndissatisfactory to some of the States as it would have been\n\ndifficult to the convention. The provision made by the convention\n\nappears, therefore, to be the best that lay within their option.\n\nIt must be satisfactory to every State, because it is conformable\n\nto the standard already established, or which may be established,\n\nby the State itself. It will be safe to the United States,\n\nbecause, being fixed by the State constitutions, it is not\n\nalterable by the State governments, and it cannot be feared that\n\nthe people of the States will alter this part of their\n\nconstitutions in such a manner as to abridge the rights secured\n\nto them by the federal Constitution. The qualifications of the\n\nelected, being less carefully and properly defined by the State\n\nconstitutions, and being at the same time more susceptible of\n\nuniformity, have been very properly considered and regulated by\n\nthe convention. A representative of the United States must be of\n\nthe age of twenty-five years; must have been seven years a\n\ncitizen of the United States; must, at the time of his election,\n\nbe an inhabitant of the State he is to represent; and, during the\n\ntime of his service, must be in no office under the United\n\nStates. Under these reasonable limitations, the door of this part\n\nof the federal government is open to merit of every description,\n\nwhether native or adoptive, whether young or old, and without\n\nregard to poverty or wealth, or to any particular profession of\n\nreligious faith. The term for which the representatives are to be\n\nelected falls under a second view which may be taken of this\n\nbranch. In order to decide on the propriety of this article, two\n\nquestions must be considered: first, whether biennial elections\n\nwill, in this case, be safe; secondly, whether they be necessary\n\nor useful. First. As it is essential to liberty that the\n\ngovernment in general should have a common interest with the\n\npeople, so it is particularly essential that the branch of it\n\nunder consideration should have an immediate dependence on, and\n\nan intimate sympathy with, the people. Frequent elections are\n\nunquestionably the only policy by which this dependence and\n\nsympathy can be effectually secured. But what particular degree\n\nof frequency may be absolutely necessary for the purpose, does\n\nnot appear to be susceptible of any precise calculation, and must\n\ndepend on a variety of circumstances with which it may be\n\nconnected. Let us consult experience, the guide that ought always\n\nto be followed whenever it can be found. The scheme of\n\nrepresentation, as a substitute for a meeting of the citizens in\n\nperson, being at most but very imperfectly known to ancient\n\npolity, it is in more modern times only that we are to expect\n\ninstructive examples. And even here, in order to avoid a research\n\ntoo vague and diffusive, it will be proper to confine ourselves\n\nto the few examples which are best known, and which bear the\n\ngreatest analogy to our particular case. The first to which this\n\ncharacter ought to be applied, is the House of Commons in Great\n\nBritain. The history of this branch of the English Constitution,\n\nanterior to the date of Magna Charta, is too obscure to yield\n\ninstruction. The very existence of it has been made a question\n\namong political antiquaries. The earliest records of subsequent\n\ndate prove that parliaments were to SIT only every year; not that\n\nthey were to be ELECTED every year. And even these annual\n\nsessions were left so much at the discretion of the monarch,\n\nthat, under various pretexts, very long and dangerous\n\nintermissions were often contrived by royal ambition. To remedy\n\nthis grievance, it was provided by a statute in the reign of\n\nCharles II. , that the intermissions should not be protracted\n\nbeyond a period of three years. On the accession of William III.\n\n, when a revolution took place in the government, the subject was\n\nstill more seriously resumed, and it was declared to be among the\n\nfundamental rights of the people that parliaments ought to be\n\nheld FREQUENTLY. By another statute, which passed a few years\n\nlater in the same reign, the term ``frequently,'' which had\n\nalluded to the triennial period settled in the time of Charles\n\nII. , is reduced to a precise meaning, it being expressly enacted\n\nthat a new parliament shall be called within three years after\n\nthe termination of the former. The last change, from three to\n\nseven years, is well known to have been introduced pretty early\n\nin the present century, under on alarm for the Hanoverian\n\nsuccession. From these facts it appears that the greatest\n\nfrequency of elections which has been deemed necessary in that\n\nkingdom, for binding the representatives to their constituents,\n\ndoes not exceed a triennial return of them. And if we may argue\n\nfrom the degree of liberty retained even under septennial\n\nelections, and all the other vicious ingredients in the\n\nparliamentary constitution, we cannot doubt that a reduction of\n\nthe period from seven to three years, with the other necessary\n\nreforms, would so far extend the influence of the people over\n\ntheir representatives as to satisfy us that biennial elections,\n\nunder the federal system, cannot possibly be dangerous to the\n\nrequisite dependence of the House of Representatives on their\n\nconstituents. Elections in Ireland, till of late, were regulated\n\nentirely by the discretion of the crown, and were seldom\n\nrepeated, except on the accession of a new prince, or some other\n\ncontingent event. The parliament which commenced with George II.\n\nwas continued throughout his whole reign, a period of about\n\nthirty-five years. The only dependence of the representatives on\n\nthe people consisted in the right of the latter to supply\n\noccasional vacancies by the election of new members, and in the\n\nchance of some event which might produce a general new election.\n\nThe ability also of the Irish parliament to maintain the rights\n\nof their constituents, so far as the disposition might exist, was\n\nextremely shackled by the control of the crown over the subjects\n\nof their deliberation. Of late these shackles, if I mistake not,\n\nhave been broken; and octennial parliaments have besides been\n\nestablished. What effect may be produced by this partial reform,\n\nmust be left to further experience. The example of Ireland, from\n\nthis view of it, can throw but little light on the subject. As\n\nfar as we can draw any conclusion from it, it must be that if the\n\npeople of that country have been able under all these\n\ndisadvantages to retain any liberty whatever, the advantage of\n\nbiennial elections would secure to them every degree of liberty,\n\nwhich might depend on a due connection between their\n\nrepresentatives and themselves. Let us bring our inquiries nearer\n\nhome. The example of these States, when British colonies, claims\n\nparticular attention, at the same time that it is so well known\n\nas to require little to be said on it. The principle of\n\nrepresentation, in one branch of the legislature at least, was\n\nestablished in all of them. But the periods of election were\n\ndifferent. They varied from one to seven years. Have we any\n\nreason to infer, from the spirit and conduct of the\n\nrepresentatives of the people, prior to the Revolution, that\n\nbiennial elections would have been dangerous to the public\n\nliberties? The spirit which everywhere displayed itself at the\n\ncommencement of the struggle, and which vanquished the obstacles\n\nto independence, is the best of proofs that a sufficient portion\n\nof liberty had been everywhere enjoyed to inspire both a sense of\n\nits worth and a zeal for its proper enlargement This remark holds\n\ngood, as well with regard to the then colonies whose elections\n\nwere least frequent, as to those whose elections were most\n\nfrequent Virginia was the colony which stood first in resisting\n\nthe parliamentary usurpations of Great Britain; it was the first\n\nalso in espousing, by public act, the resolution of independence.\n\nIn Virginia, nevertheless, if I have not been misinformed,\n\nelections under the former government were septennial. This\n\nparticular example is brought into view, not as a proof of any\n\npeculiar merit, for the priority in those instances was probably\n\naccidental; and still less of any advantage in SEPTENNIAL\n\nelections, for when compared with a greater frequency they are\n\ninadmissible; but merely as a proof, and I conceive it to be a\n\nvery substantial proof, that the liberties of the people can be\n\nin no danger from BIENNIAL elections. The conclusion resulting\n\nfrom these examples will be not a little strengthened by\n\nrecollecting three circumstances. The first is, that the federal\n\nlegislature will possess a part only of that supreme legislative\n\nauthority which is vested completely in the British Parliament;\n\nand which, with a few exceptions, was exercised by the colonial\n\nassemblies and the Irish legislature. It is a received and\n\nwell-founded maxim, that where no other circumstances affect the\n\ncase, the greater the power is, the shorter ought to be its\n\nduration; and, conversely, the smaller the power, the more safely\n\nmay its duration be protracted. In the second place, it has, on\n\nanother occasion, been shown that the federal legislature will\n\nnot only be restrained by its dependence on its people, as other\n\nlegislative bodies are, but that it will be, moreover, watched\n\nand controlled by the several collateral legislatures, which\n\nother legislative bodies are not. And in the third place, no\n\ncomparison can be made between the means that will be possessed\n\nby the more permanent branches of the federal government for\n\nseducing, if they should be disposed to seduce, the House of\n\nRepresentatives from their duty to the people, and the means of\n\ninfluence over the popular branch possessed by the other branches\n\nof the government above cited. With less power, therefore, to\n\nabuse, the federal representatives can be less tempted on one\n\nside, and will be doubly watched on the other. PUBLIUS.",

        "content": "The Same Subject Continued(The House of Representatives)\n\nFrom the New York Packet. Tuesday, February 12, 1788.\n\nTo the People of the State of New York:\n\nI SHALL here, perhaps, be reminded of a current observation,\n\n``that where annual elections end, tyranny begins. '' If it be\n\ntrue, as has often been remarked, that sayings which become\n\nproverbial are generally founded in reason, it is not less true,\n\nthat when once established, they are often applied to cases to\n\nwhich the reason of them does not extend. I need not look for a\n\nproof beyond the case before us. What is the reason on which this\n\nproverbial observation is founded? No man will subject himself to\n\nthe ridicule of pretending that any natural connection subsists\n\nbetween the sun or the seasons, and the period within which human\n\nvirtue can bear the temptations of power. Happily for mankind,\n\nliberty is not, in this respect, confined to any single point of\n\ntime; but lies within extremes, which afford sufficient latitude\n\nfor all the variations which may be required by the various\n\nsituations and circumstances of civil society. The election of\n\nmagistrates might be, if it were found expedient, as in some\n\ninstances it actually has been, daily, weekly, or monthly, as\n\nwell as annual; and if circumstances may require a deviation from\n\nthe rule on one side, why not also on the other side? Turning our\n\nattention to the periods established among ourselves, for the\n\nelection of the most numerous branches of the State legislatures,\n\nwe find them by no means coinciding any more in this instance,\n\nthan in the elections of other civil magistrates. In Connecticut\n\nand Rhode Island, the periods are half-yearly. In the other\n\nStates, South Carolina excepted, they are annual. In South\n\nCarolina they are biennial as is proposed in the federal\n\ngovernment. Here is a difference, as four to one, between the\n\nlongest and shortest periods; and yet it would be not easy to\n\nshow, that Connecticut or Rhode Island is better governed, or\n\nenjoys a greater share of rational liberty, than South Carolina;\n\nor that either the one or the other of these States is\n\ndistinguished in these respects, and by these causes, from the\n\nStates whose elections are different from both. In searching for\n\nthe grounds of this doctrine, I can discover but one, and that is\n\nwholly inapplicable to our case. The important distinction so\n\nwell understood in America, between a Constitution established by\n\nthe people and unalterable by the government, and a law\n\nestablished by the government and alterable by the government,\n\nseems to have been little understood and less observed in any\n\nother country. Wherever the supreme power of legislation has\n\nresided, has been supposed to reside also a full power to change\n\nthe form of the government. Even in Great Britain, where the\n\nprinciples of political and civil liberty have been most\n\ndiscussed, and where we hear most of the rights of the\n\nConstitution, it is maintained that the authority of the\n\nParliament is transcendent and uncontrollable, as well with\n\nregard to the Constitution, as the ordinary objects of\n\nlegislative provision. They have accordingly, in several\n\ninstances, actually changed, by legislative acts, some of the\n\nmost fundamental articles of the government. They have in\n\nparticular, on several occasions, changed the period of election;\n\nand, on the last occasion, not only introduced septennial in\n\nplace of triennial elections, but by the same act, continued\n\nthemselves in place four years beyond the term for which they\n\nwere elected by the people. An attention to these dangerous\n\npractices has produced a very natural alarm in the votaries of\n\nfree government, of which frequency of elections is the\n\ncorner-stone; and has led them to seek for some security to\n\nliberty, against the danger to which it is exposed. Where no\n\nConstitution, paramount to the government, either existed or\n\ncould be obtained, no constitutional security, similar to that\n\nestablished in the United States, was to be attempted. Some\n\nother security, therefore, was to be sought for; and what better\n\nsecurity would the case admit, than that of selecting and\n\nappealing to some simple and familiar portion of time, as a\n\nstandard for measuring the danger of innovations, for fixing the\n\nnational sentiment, and for uniting the patriotic exertions? The\n\nmost simple and familiar portion of time, applicable to the\n\nsubject was that of a year; and hence the doctrine has been\n\ninculcated by a laudable zeal, to erect some barrier against the\n\ngradual innovations of an unlimited government, that the advance\n\ntowards tyranny was to be calculated by the distance of departure\n\nfrom the fixed point of annual elections. But what necessity can\n\nthere be of applying this expedient to a government limited, as\n\nthe federal government will be, by the authority of a paramount\n\nConstitution? Or who will pretend that the liberties of the\n\npeople of America will not be more secure under biennial\n\nelections, unalterably fixed by such a Constitution, than those\n\nof any other nation would be, where elections were annual, or\n\neven more frequent, but subject to alterations by the ordinary\n\npower of the government? The second question stated is, whether\n\nbiennial elections be necessary or useful. The propriety of\n\nanswering this question in the affirmative will appear from\n\nseveral very obvious considerations.\n\nNo man can be a\n\ncompetent legislator who does not add to an upright intention and\n\na sound judgment a certain degree of knowledge of the subjects on\n\nwhich he is to legislate. A part of this knowledge may be\n\nacquired by means of information which lie within the compass of\n\nmen in private as well as public stations. Another part can only\n\nbe attained, or at least thoroughly attained, by actual\n\nexperience in the station which requires the use of it. The\n\nperiod of service, ought, therefore, in all such cases, to bear\n\nsome proportion to the extent of practical knowledge requisite to\n\nthe due performance of the service. The period of legislative\n\nservice established in most of the States for the more numerous\n\nbranch is, as we have seen, one year. The question then may be\n\nput into this simple form: does the period of two years bear no\n\ngreater proportion to the knowledge requisite for federal\n\nlegislation than one year does to the knowledge requisite for\n\nState legislation? The very statement of the question, in this\n\nform, suggests the answer that ought to be given to it. In a\n\nsingle State, the requisite knowledge relates to the existing\n\nlaws which are uniform throughout the State, and with which all\n\nthe citizens are more or less conversant; and to the general\n\naffairs of the State, which lie within a small compass, are not\n\nvery diversified, and occupy much of the attention and\n\nconversation of every class of people. The great theatre of the\n\nUnited States presents a very different scene. The laws are so\n\nfar from being uniform, that they vary in every State; whilst the\n\npublic affairs of the Union are spread throughout a very\n\nextensive region, and are extremely diversified by t e local\n\naffairs connected with them, and can with difficulty be correctly\n\nlearnt in any other place than in the central councils to which a\n\nknowledge of them will be brought by the representatives of every\n\npart of the empire. Yet some knowledge of the affairs, and even\n\nof the laws, of all the States, ought to be possessed by the\n\nmembers from each of the States. How can foreign trade be\n\nproperly regulated by uniform laws, without some acquaintance\n\nwith the commerce, the ports, the usages, and the regulatious of\n\nthe different States? How can the trade between the different\n\nStates be duly regulated, without some knowledge of their\n\nrelative situations in these and other respects? How can taxes\n\nbe judiciously imposed and effectually collected, if they be not\n\naccommodated to the different laws and local circumstances\n\nrelating to these objects in the different States? How can\n\nuniform regulations for the militia be duly provided, without a\n\nsimilar knowledge of many internal circumstances by which the\n\nStates are distinguished from each other? These are the\n\nprincipal objects of federal legislation, and suggest most\n\nforcibly the extensive information which the representatives\n\nought to acquire. The other interior objects will require a\n\nproportional degree of information with regard to them. It is\n\ntrue that all these difficulties will, by degrees, be very much\n\ndiminished. The most laborious task will be the proper\n\ninauguration of the government and the primeval formation of a\n\nfederal code. Improvements on the first draughts will every year\n\nbecome both easier and fewer. Past transactions of the\n\ngovernment will be a ready and accurate source of information to\n\nnew members. The affairs of the Union will become more and more\n\nobjects of curiosity and conversation among the citizens at\n\nlarge. And the increased intercourse among those of different\n\nStates will contribute not a little to diffuse a mutual knowledge\n\nof their affairs, as this again will contribute to a general\n\nassimilation of their manners and laws. But with all these\n\nabatements, the business of federal legislation must continue so\n\nfar to exceed, both in novelty and difficulty, the legislative\n\nbusiness of a single State, as to justify the longer period of\n\nservice assigned to those who are to transact it. A branch of\n\nknowledge which belongs to the acquirements of a federal\n\nrepresentative, and which has not been mentioned is that of\n\nforeign affairs. In regulating our own commerce he ought to be\n\nnot only acquainted with the treaties between the United States\n\nand other nations, but also with the commercial policy and laws\n\nof other nations. He ought not to be altogether ignorant of the\n\nlaw of nations; for that, as far as it is a proper object of\n\nmunicipal legislation, is submitted to the federal government.\n\nAnd although the House of Representatives is not immediately to\n\nparticipate in foreign negotiations and arrangements, yet from\n\nthe necessary connection between the several branches of public\n\naffairs, those particular branches will frequently deserve\n\nattention in the ordinary course of legislation, and will\n\nsometimes demand particular legislative sanction and\n\nco-operation. Some portion of this knowledge may, no doubt, be\n\nacquired in a man's closet; but some of it also can only be\n\nderived from the public sources of information; and all of it\n\nwill be acquired to best effect by a practical attention to the\n\nsubject during the period of actual service in the legislature.\n\nThere are other considerations, of less importance, perhaps, but\n\nwhich are not unworthy of notice. The distance which many of the\n\nrepresentatives will be obliged to travel, and the arrangements\n\nrendered necessary by that circumstance, might be much more\n\nserious objections with fit men to this service, if limited to a\n\nsingle year, than if extended to two years. No argument can be\n\ndrawn on this subject, from the case of the delegates to the\n\nexisting Congress. They are elected annually, it is true; but\n\ntheir re-election is considered by the legislative assemblies\n\nalmost as a matter of course. The election of the representatives\n\nby the people would not be governed by the same principle. A few\n\nof the members, as happens in all such assemblies, will possess\n\nsuperior talents; will, by frequent reelections, become members\n\nof long standing; will be thoroughly masters of the public\n\nbusiness, and perhaps not unwilling to avail themselves of those\n\nadvantages. The greater the proportion of new members, and the\n\nless the information of the bulk of the members the more apt will\n\nthey be to fall into the snares that may be laid for them. This\n\nremark is no less applicable to the relation which will subsist\n\nbetween the House of Representatives and the Senate. It is an\n\ninconvenience mingled with the advantages of our frequent\n\nelections even in single States, where they are large, and hold\n\nbut one legislative session in a year, that spurious elections\n\ncannot be investigated and annulled in time for the decision to\n\nhave its due effect. If a return can be obtained, no matter by\n\nwhat unlawful means, the irregular member, who takes his seat of\n\ncourse, is sure of holding it a sufficient time to answer his\n\npurposes. Hence, a very pernicious encouragement is given to the\n\nuse of unlawful means, for obtaining irregular returns. Were\n\nelections for the federal legislature to be annual, this practice\n\nmight become a very serious abuse, particularly in the more\n\ndistant States. Each house is, as it necessarily must be, the\n\njudge of the elections, qualifications, and returns of its\n\nmembers; and whatever improvements may be suggested by\n\nexperience, for simplifying and accelerating the process in\n\ndisputed cases, so great a portion of a year would unavoidably\n\nelapse, before an illegitimate member could be dispossessed of\n\nhis seat, that the prospect of such an event would be little\n\ncheck to unfair and illicit means of obtaining a seat. All these\n\nconsiderations taken together warrant us in affirming, that\n\nbiennial elections will be as useful to the affairs of the public\n\nas we have seen that they will be safe to the liberty of the\n\npeople.

        "content": "The Senate Continued\n\nFor the Independent Journal.\n\nTo the People of the State of New York:\n\nA FIFTH desideratum, illustrating the utility of a senate, is\n\nthe want of a due sense of national character. Without a select and\n\nstable member of the government, the esteem of foreign powers will\n\nnot only be forfeited by an unenlightened and variable policy,\n\nproceeding from the causes already mentioned, but the national\n\ncouncils will not possess that sensibility to the opinion of the\n\nworld, which is perhaps not less necessary in order to merit, than\n\nit is to obtain, its respect and confidence.\n\nAn attention to the judgment of other nations is important to\n\nevery government for two reasons: the one is, that, independently\n\nof the merits of any particular plan or measure, it is desirable, on\n\nvarious accounts, that it should appear to other nations as the\n\noffspring of a wise and honorable policy; the second is, that in\n\ndoubtful cases, particularly where the national councils may be\n\nwarped by some strong passion or momentary interest, the presumed or\n\nknown opinion of the impartial world may be the best guide that can\n\nbe followed. What has not America lost by her want of character\n\nwith foreign nations; and how many errors and follies would she not\n\nhave avoided, if the justice and propriety of her measures had, in\n\nevery instance, been previously tried by the light in which they\n\nwould probably appear to the unbiased part of mankind?\n\nYet however requisite a sense of national character may be, it\n\nis evident that it can never be sufficiently possessed by a numerous\n\nand changeable body. It can only be found in a number so small that\n\na sensible degree of the praise and blame of public measures may be\n\nthe portion of each individual; or in an assembly so durably\n\ninvested with public trust, that the pride and consequence of its\n\nmembers may be sensibly incorporated with the reputation and\n\nprosperity of the community. The half-yearly representatives of\n\nRhode Island would probably have been little affected in their\n\ndeliberations on the iniquitous measures of that State, by arguments\n\ndrawn from the light in which such measures would be viewed by\n\nforeign nations, or even by the sister States; whilst it can\n\nscarcely be doubted that if the concurrence of a select and stable\n\nbody had been necessary, a regard to national character alone would\n\nhave prevented the calamities under which that misguided people is\n\nnow laboring.\n\nI add, as a SIXTH defect the want, in some important cases, of a\n\ndue responsibility in the government to the people, arising from\n\nthat frequency of elections which in other cases produces this\n\nresponsibility. This remark will, perhaps, appear not only new, but\n\nparadoxical. It must nevertheless be acknowledged, when explained,\n\nto be as undeniable as it is important.\n\nResponsibility, in order to be reasonable, must be limited to\n\nobjects within the power of the responsible party, and in order to\n\nbe effectual, must relate to operations of that power, of which a\n\nready and proper judgment can be formed by the constituents. The\n\nobjects of government may be divided into two general classes: the\n\none depending on measures which have singly an immediate and\n\nsensible operation; the other depending on a succession of\n\nwell-chosen and well-connected measures, which have a gradual and\n\nperhaps unobserved operation. The importance of the latter\n\ndescription to the collective and permanent welfare of every\n\ncountry, needs no explanation. And yet it is evident that an\n\nassembly elected for so short a term as to be unable to provide more\n\nthan one or two links in a chain of measures, on which the general\n\nwelfare may essentially depend, ought not to be answerable for the\n\nfinal result, any more than a steward or tenant, engaged for one\n\nyear, could be justly made to answer for places or improvements\n\nwhich could not be accomplished in less than half a dozen years.\n\nNor is it possible for the people to estimate the SHARE of\n\ninfluence which their annual assemblies may respectively have on\n\nevents resulting from the mixed transactions of several years. It\n\nis sufficiently difficult to preserve a personal responsibility in\n\nthe members of a NUMEROUS body, for such acts of the body as have an\n\nimmediate, detached, and palpable operation on its constituents.\n\nThe proper remedy for this defect must be an additional body in\n\nthe legislative department, which, having sufficient permanency to\n\nprovide for such objects as require a continued attention, and a\n\ntrain of measures, may be justly and effectually answerable for the\n\nattainment of those objects.\n\nThus far I have considered the circumstances which point out the\n\nnecessity of a well-constructed Senate only as they relate to the\n\nrepresentatives of the people. To a people as little blinded by\n\nprejudice or corrupted by flattery as those whom I address, I shall\n\nnot scruple to add, that such an institution may be sometimes\n\nnecessary as a defense to the people against their own temporary\n\nerrors and delusions. As the cool and deliberate sense of the\n\ncommunity ought, in all governments, and actually will, in all free\n\ngovernments, ultimately prevail over the views of its rulers; so\n\nthere are particular moments in public affairs when the people,\n\nstimulated by some irregular passion, or some illicit advantage, or\n\nmisled by the artful misrepresentations of interested men, may call\n\nfor measures which they themselves will afterwards be the most ready\n\nto lament and condemn. In these critical moments, how salutary will\n\nbe the interference of some temperate and respectable body of\n\ncitizens, in order to check the misguided career, and to suspend the\n\nblow meditated by the people against themselves, until reason,\n\njustice, and truth can regain their authority over the public mind?\n\nWhat bitter anguish would not the people of Athens have often\n\nescaped if their government had contained so provident a safeguard\n\nagainst the tyranny of their own passions? Popular liberty might\n\nthen have escaped the indelible reproach of decreeing to the same\n\ncitizens the hemlock on one day and statues on the next.\n\nIt may be suggested, that a people spread over an extensive\n\nregion cannot, like the crowded inhabitants of a small district, be\n\nsubject to the infection of violent passions, or to the danger of\n\ncombining in pursuit of unjust measures. I am far from denying that\n\nthis is a distinction of peculiar importance. I have, on the\n\ncontrary, endeavored in a former paper to show, that it is one of\n\nthe principal recommendations of a confederated republic. At the\n\nsame time, this advantage ought not to be considered as superseding\n\nthe use of auxiliary precautions. It may even be remarked, that the\n\nsame extended situation, which will exempt the people of America\n\nfrom some of the dangers incident to lesser republics, will expose\n\nthem to the inconveniency of remaining for a longer time under the\n\ninfluence of those misrepresentations which the combined industry of\n\ninterested men may succeed in distributing among them.\n\nIt adds no small weight to all these considerations, to\n\nrecollect that history informs us of no long-lived republic which\n\nhad not a senate. Sparta, Rome, and Carthage are, in fact, the only\n\nstates to whom that character can be applied. In each of the two\n\nfirst there was a senate for life. The constitution of the senate\n\nin the last is less known. Circumstantial evidence makes it\n\nprobable that it was not different in this particular from the two\n\nothers. It is at least certain, that it had some quality or other\n\nwhich rendered it an anchor against popular fluctuations; and that\n\na smaller council, drawn out of the senate, was appointed not only\n\nfor life, but filled up vacancies itself. These examples, though as\n\nunfit for the imitation, as they are repugnant to the genius, of\n\nAmerica, are, notwithstanding, when compared with the fugitive and\n\nturbulent existence of other ancient republics, very instructive\n\nproofs of the necessity of some institution that will blend\n\nstability with liberty. I am not unaware of the circumstances which\n\ndistinguish the American from other popular governments, as well\n\nancient as modern; and which render extreme circumspection\n\nnecessary, in reasoning from the one case to the other. But after\n\nallowing due weight to this consideration, it may still be\n\nmaintained, that there are many points of similitude which render\n\nthese examples not unworthy of our attention. Many of the defects,\n\nas we have seen, which can only be supplied by a senatorial\n\ninstitution, are common to a numerous assembly frequently elected by\n\nthe people, and to the people themselves. There are others peculiar\n\nto the former, which require the control of such an institution.\n\nThe people can never wilfully betray their own interests; but they\n\nmay possibly be betrayed by the representatives of the people; and\n\nthe danger will be evidently greater where the whole legislative\n\ntrust is lodged in the hands of one body of men, than where the\n\nconcurrence of separate and dissimilar bodies is required in every\n\npublic act.\n\nThe difference most relied on, between the American and other\n\nrepublics, consists in the principle of representation; which is\n\nthe pivot on which the former move, and which is supposed to have\n\nbeen unknown to the latter, or at least to the ancient part of them.\n\nThe use which has been made of this difference, in reasonings\n\ncontained in former papers, will have shown that I am disposed\n\nneither to deny its existence nor to undervalue its importance. I\n\nfeel the less restraint, therefore, in observing, that the position\n\nconcerning the ignorance of the ancient governments on the subject\n\nof representation, is by no means precisely true in the latitude\n\ncommonly given to it. Without entering into a disquisition which\n\nhere would be misplaced, I will refer to a few known facts, in\n\nsupport of what I advance.\n\nIn the most pure democracies of Greece, many of the executive\n\nfunctions were performed, not by the people themselves, but by\n\nofficers elected by the people, and REPRESENTING the people in their\n\nEXECUTIVE capacity.\n\nPrior to the reform of Solon, Athens was governed by nine\n\nArchons, annually ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE AT LARGE. The degree of\n\npower delegated to them seems to be left in great obscurity.\n\nSubsequent to that period, we find an assembly, first of four, and\n\nafterwards of six hundred members, annually ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE;\n\nand PARTIALLY representing them in their LEGISLATIVE capacity,\n\nsince they were not only associated with the people in the function\n\nof making laws, but had the exclusive right of originating\n\nlegislative propositions to the people. The senate of Carthage,\n\nalso, whatever might be its power, or the duration of its\n\nappointment, appears to have been ELECTIVE by the suffrages of the\n\npeople. Similar instances might be traced in most, if not all the\n\npopular governments of antiquity.\n\nLastly, in Sparta we meet with the Ephori, and in Rome with the\n\nTribunes; two bodies, small indeed in numbers, but annually ELECTED\n\nBY THE WHOLE BODY OF THE PEOPLE, and considered as the\n\nREPRESENTATIVES of the people, almost in their PLENIPOTENTIARY\n\ncapacity. The Cosmi of Crete were also annually ELECTED BY THE\n\nPEOPLE, and have been considered by some authors as an institution\n\nanalogous to those of Sparta and Rome, with this difference only,\n\nthat in the election of that representative body the right of\n\nsuffrage was communicated to a part only of the people.\n\nFrom these facts, to which many others might be added, it is\n\nclear that the principle of representation was neither unknown to\n\nthe ancients nor wholly overlooked in their political constitutions.\n\nThe true distinction between these and the American governments,\n\nlies IN THE TOTAL EXCLUSION OF THE PEOPLE, IN THEIR COLLECTIVE\n\nCAPACITY, from any share in the LATTER, and not in the TOTAL\n\nEXCLUSION OF THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE from the\n\nadministration of the FORMER. The distinction, however, thus\n\nqualified, must be admitted to leave a most advantageous superiority\n\nin favor of the United States. But to insure to this advantage its\n\nfull effect, we must be careful not to separate it from the other\n\nadvantage, of an extensive territory. For it cannot be believed,\n\nthat any form of representative government could have succeeded\n\nwithin the narrow limits occupied by the democracies of Greece.\n\nIn answer to all these arguments, suggested by reason,\n\nillustrated by examples, and enforced by our own experience, the\n\njealous adversary of the Constitution will probably content himself\n\nwith repeating, that a senate appointed not immediately by the\n\npeople, and for the term of six years, must gradually acquire a\n\ndangerous pre-eminence in the government, and finally transform it\n\ninto a tyrannical aristocracy.\n\nTo this general answer, the general reply ought to be\n\nsufficient, that liberty may be endangered by the abuses of liberty\n\nas well as by the abuses of power; that there are numerous\n\ninstances of the former as well as of the latter; and that the\n\nformer, rather than the latter, are apparently most to be\n\napprehended by the United States. But a more particular reply may\n\nbe given.\n\nBefore such a revolution can be effected, the Senate, it is to\n\nbe observed, must in the first place corrupt itself; must next\n\ncorrupt the State legislatures; must then corrupt the House of\n\nRepresentatives; and must finally corrupt the people at large. It\n\nis evident that the Senate must be first corrupted before it can\n\nattempt an establishment of tyranny. Without corrupting the State\n\nlegislatures, it cannot prosecute the attempt, because the\n\nperiodical change of members would otherwise regenerate the whole\n\nbody. Without exerting the means of corruption with equal success\n\non the House of Representatives, the opposition of that coequal\n\nbranch of the government would inevitably defeat the attempt; and\n\nwithout corrupting the people themselves, a succession of new\n\nrepresentatives would speedily restore all things to their pristine\n\norder. Is there any man who can seriously persuade himself that the\n\nproposed Senate can, by any possible means within the compass of\n\nhuman address, arrive at the object of a lawless ambition, through\n\nall these obstructions?\n\nIf reason condemns the suspicion, the same sentence is\n\npronounced by experience. The constitution of Maryland furnishes\n\nthe most apposite example. The Senate of that State is elected, as\n\nthe federal Senate will be, indirectly by the people, and for a term\n\nless by one year only than the federal Senate. It is distinguished,\n\nalso, by the remarkable prerogative of filling up its own vacancies\n\nwithin the term of its appointment, and, at the same time, is not\n\nunder the control of any such rotation as is provided for the\n\nfederal Senate. There are some other lesser distinctions, which\n\nwould expose the former to colorable objections, that do not lie\n\nagainst the latter. If the federal Senate, therefore, really\n\ncontained the danger which has been so loudly proclaimed, some\n\nsymptoms at least of a like danger ought by this time to have been\n\nbetrayed by the Senate of Maryland, but no such symptoms have\n\nappeared. On the contrary, the jealousies at first entertained by\n\nmen of the same description with those who view with terror the\n\ncorrespondent part of the federal Constitution, have been gradually\n\nextinguished by the progress of the experiment; and the Maryland\n\nconstitution is daily deriving, from the salutary operation of this\n\npart of it, a reputation in which it will probably not be rivalled\n\nby that of any State in the Union.\n\nBut if any thing could silence the jealousies on this subject,\n\nit ought to be the British example. The Senate there instead of\n\nbeing elected for a term of six years, and of being unconfined to\n\nparticular families or fortunes, is an hereditary assembly of\n\nopulent nobles. The House of Representatives, instead of being\n\nelected for two years, and by the whole body of the people, is\n\nelected for seven years, and, in very great proportion, by a very\n\nsmall proportion of the people. Here, unquestionably, ought to be\n\nseen in full display the aristocratic usurpations and tyranny which\n\nare at some future period to be exemplified in the United States.\n\nUnfortunately, however, for the anti-federal argument, the British\n\nhistory informs us that this hereditary assembly has not been able\n\nto defend itself against the continual encroachments of the House of\n\nRepresentatives; and that it no sooner lost the support of the\n\nmonarch, than it was actually crushed by the weight of the popular\n\nbranch.\n\nAs far as antiquity can instruct us on this subject, its\n\nexamples support the reasoning which we have employed. In Sparta,\n\nthe Ephori, the annual representatives of the people, were found an\n\novermatch for the senate for life, continually gained on its\n\nauthority and finally drew all power into their own hands. The\n\nTribunes of Rome, who were the representatives of the people,\n\nprevailed, it is well known, in almost every contest with the senate\n\nfor life, and in the end gained the most complete triumph over it.\n\nThe fact is the more remarkable, as unanimity was required in every\n\nact of the Tribunes, even after their number was augmented to ten.\n\nIt proves the irresistible force possessed by that branch of a free\n\ngovernment, which has the people on its side. To these examples\n\nmight be added that of Carthage, whose senate, according to the\n\ntestimony of Polybius, instead of drawing all power into its vortex,\n\nhad, at the commencement of the second Punic War, lost almost the\n\nwhole of its original portion.\n\nBesides the conclusive evidence resulting from this assemblage\n\nof facts, that the federal Senate will never be able to transform\n\nitself, by gradual usurpations, into an independent and aristocratic\n\nbody, we are warranted in believing, that if such a revolution\n\nshould ever happen from causes which the foresight of man cannot\n\nguard against, the House of Representatives, with the people on\n\ntheir side, will at all times be able to bring back the Constitution\n\nto its primitive form and principles. Against the force of the\n\nimmediate representatives of the people, nothing will be able to\n\nmaintain even the constitutional authority of the Senate, but such a\n\ndisplay of enlightened policy, and attachment to the public good, as\n\nwill divide with that branch of the legislature the affections and\n\nsupport of the entire body of the people themselves.\n\nPUBLIUS.",

        "content": "The Alleged Tendency of the New Plan to Elevate the Few at the\n\nExpense of the Many Considered in Connection with Representation\n\nFrom the New York Packet. Tuesday, February 19, 1788.\n\nTo the People of the State of New York:\n\nTHE THIRD charge against the House of Representatives is, that it\n\nwill be taken from that class of citizens which will have least\n\nsympathy with the mass of the people, and be most likely to aim\n\nat an ambitious sacrifice of the many to the aggrandizement of\n\nthe few. Of all the objections which have been framed against the\n\nfederal Constitution, this is perhaps the most extraordinary.\n\nWhilst the objection itself is levelled against a pretended\n\noligarchy, the principle of it strikes at the very root of\n\nrepublican government. The aim of every political constitution\n\nis, or ought to be, first to obtain for rulers men who possess\n\nmost wisdom to discern, and most virtue to pursue, the common\n\ngood of the society; and in the next place, to take the most\n\neffectual precautions for keeping them virtuous whilst they\n\ncontinue to hold their public trust. The elective mode of\n\nobtaining rulers is the characteristic policy of republican\n\ngovernment. The means relied on in this form of government for\n\npreventing their degeneracy are numerous and various. The most\n\neffectual one, is such a limitation of the term of appointments\n\nas will maintain a proper responsibility to the people. Let me\n\nnow ask what circumstance there is in the constitution of the\n\nHouse of Representatives that violates the principles of\n\nrepublican government, or favors the elevation of the few on the\n\nruins of the many? Let me ask whether every circumstance is not,\n\non the contrary, strictly conformable to these principles, and\n\nscrupulously impartial to the rights and pretensions of every\n\nclass and description of citizens? Who are to be the electors of\n\nthe federal representatives? Not the rich, more than the poor;\n\nnot the learned, more than the ignorant; not the haughty heirs of\n\ndistinguished names, more than the humble sons of obscurity and\n\nunpropitious fortune. The electors are to be the great body of\n\nthe people of the United States. They are to be the same who\n\nexercise the right in every State of electing the corresponding\n\nbranch of the legislature of the State. Who are to be the objects\n\nof popular choice? Every citizen whose merit may recommend him to\n\nthe esteem and confidence of his country. No qualification of\n\nwealth, of birth, of religious faith, or of civil profession is\n\npermitted to fetter the judgement or disappoint the inclination\n\nof the people. If we consider the situation of the men on whom\n\nthe free suffrages of their fellow-citizens may confer the\n\nrepresentative trust, we shall find it involving every security\n\nwhich can be devised or desired for their fidelity to their\n\nconstituents. In the first place, as they will have been\n\ndistinguished by the preference of their fellow-citizens, we are\n\nto presume that in general they will be somewhat distinguished\n\nalso by those qualities which entitle them to it, and which\n\npromise a sincere and scrupulous regard to the nature of their\n\nengagements. In the second place, they will enter into the public\n\nservice under circumstances which cannot fail to produce a\n\ntemporary affection at least to their constituents. There is in\n\nevery breast a sensibility to marks of honor, of favor, of\n\nesteem, and of confidence, which, apart from all considerations\n\nof interest, is some pledge for grateful and benevolent returns.\n\nIngratitude is a common topic of declamation against human\n\nnature; and it must be confessed that instances of it are but too\n\nfrequent and flagrant, both in public and in private life. But\n\nthe universal and extreme indignation which it inspires is itself\n\na proof of the energy and prevalence of the contrary sentiment.\n\nIn the third place, those ties which bind the representative to\n\nhis constituents are strengthened by motives of a more selfish\n\nnature. His pride and vanity attach him to a form of government\n\nwhich favors his pretensions and gives him a share in its honors\n\nand distinctions. Whatever hopes or projects might be entertained\n\nby a few aspiring characters, it must generally happen that a\n\ngreat proportion of the men deriving their advancement from their\n\ninfluence with the people, would have more to hope from a\n\npreservation of the favor, than from innovations in the\n\ngovernment subversive of the authority of the people. All these\n\nsecurities, however, would be found very insufficient without the\n\nrestraint of frequent elections. Hence, in the fourth place, the\n\nHouse of Representatives is so constituted as to support in the\n\nmembers an habitual recollection of their dependence on the\n\npeople. Before the sentiments impressed on their minds by the\n\nmode of their elevation can be effaced by the exercise of power,\n\nthey will be compelled to anticipate the moment when their power\n\nis to cease, when their exercise of it is to be reviewed, and\n\nwhen they must descend to the level from which they were raised;\n\nthere forever to remain unless a faithful discharge of their\n\ntrust shall have established their title to a renewal of it. I\n\nwill add, as a fifth circumstance in the situation of the House\n\nof Representatives, restraining them from oppressive measures,\n\nthat they can make no law which will not have its full operation\n\non themselves and their friends, as well as on the great mass of\n\nthe society. This has always been deemed one of the strongest\n\nbonds by which human policy can connect the rulers and the people\n\ntogether. It creates between them that communion of interests and\n\nsympathy of sentiments, of which few governments have furnished\n\nexamples; but without which every government degenerates into\n\ntyranny. If it be asked, what is to restrain the House of\n\nRepresentatives from making legal discriminations in favor of\n\nthemselves and a particular class of the society? I answer: the\n\ngenius of the whole system; the nature of just and constitutional\n\nlaws; and above all, the vigilant and manly spirit which actuates\n\nthe people of America, a spirit which nourishes freedom, and in\n\nreturn is nourished by it. If this spirit shall ever be so far\n\ndebased as to tolerate a law not obligatory on the legislature,\n\nas well as on the people, the people will be prepared to tolerate\n\nany thing but liberty. Such will be the relation between the\n\nHouse of Representatives and their constituents. Duty, gratitude,\n\ninterest, ambition itself, are the chords by which they will be\n\nbound to fidelity and sympathy with the great mass of the people.\n\nIt is possible that these may all be insufficient to control the\n\ncaprice and wickedness of man. But are they not all that\n\ngovernment will admit, and that human prudence can devise? Are\n\nthey not the genuine and the characteristic means by which\n\nrepublican government provides for the liberty and happiness of\n\nthe people? Are they not the identical means on which every State\n\ngovernment in the Union relies for the attainment of these\n\nimportant ends? What then are we to understand by the objection\n\nwhich this paper has combated? What are we to say to the men who\n\nprofess the most flaming zeal for republican government, yet\n\nboldly impeach the fundamental principle of it; who pretend to be\n\nchampions for the right and the capacity of the people to choose\n\ntheir own rulers, yet maintain that they will prefer those only\n\nwho will immediately and infallibly betray the trust committed to\n\nthem? Were the objection to be read by one who had not seen the\n\nmode prescribed by the Constitution for the choice of\n\nrepresentatives, he could suppose nothing less than that some\n\nunreasonable qualification of property was annexed to the right\n\nof suffrage; or that the right of eligibility was limited to\n\npersons of particular families or fortunes; or at least that the\n\nmode prescribed by the State constitutions was in some respect or\n\nother, very grossly departed from. We have seen how far such a\n\nsupposition would err, as to the two first points. Nor would it,\n\nin fact, be less erroneous as to the last. The only difference\n\ndiscoverable between the two cases is, that each representative\n\nof the United States will be elected by five or six thousand\n\ncitizens; whilst in the individual States, the election of a\n\nrepresentative is left to about as many hundreds. Will it be\n\npretended that this difference is sufficient to justify an\n\nattachment to the State governments, and an abhorrence to the\n\nfederal government? If this be the point on which the objection\n\nturns, it deserves to be examined. Is it supported by REASON?\n\nThis cannot be said, without maintaining that five or six\n\nthousand citizens are less capable of choosing a fit\n\nrepresentative, or more liable to be corrupted by an unfit one,\n\nthan five or six hundred. Reason, on the contrary, assures us,\n\nthat as in so great a number a fit representative would be most\n\nlikely to be found, so the choice would be less likely to be\n\ndiverted from him by the intrigues of the ambitious or the\n\nambitious or the bribes of the rich. Is the CONSEQUENCE from\n\nthis doctrine admissible? If we say that five or six hundred\n\ncitizens are as many as can jointly exercise their right of\n\nsuffrage, must we not deprive the people of the immediate choice\n\nof their public servants, in every instance where the\n\nadministration of the government does not require as many of them\n\nas will amount to one for that number of citizens? Is the\n\ndoctrine warranted by FACTS? It was shown in the last paper, that\n\nthe real representation in the British House of Commons very\n\nlittle exceeds the proportion of one for every thirty thousand\n\ninhabitants. Besides a variety of powerful causes not existing\n\nhere, and which favor in that country the pretensions of rank and\n\nwealth, no person is eligible as a representative of a county,\n\nunless he possess real estate of the clear value of six hundred\n\npounds sterling per year; nor of a city or borough, unless he\n\npossess a like estate of half that annual value. To this\n\nqualification on the part of the county representatives is added\n\nanother on the part of the county electors, which restrains the\n\nright of suffrage to persons having a freehold estate of the\n\nannual value of more than twenty pounds sterling, according to\n\nthe present rate of money. Notwithstanding these unfavorable\n\ncircumstances, and notwithstanding some very unequal laws in the\n\nBritish code, it cannot be said that the representatives of the\n\nnation have elevated the few on the ruins of the many. But we\n\nneed not resort to foreign experience on this subject. Our own\n\nis explicit and decisive. The districts in New Hampshire in\n\nwhich the senators are chosen immediately by the people, are\n\nnearly as large as will be necessary for her representatives in\n\nthe Congress. Those of Massachusetts are larger than will be\n\nnecessary for that purpose; and those of New York still more so.\n\nIn the last State the members of Assembly for the cities and\n\ncounties of New York and Albany are elected by very nearly as\n\nmany voters as will be entitled to a representative in the\n\nCongress, calculating on the number of sixty-five representatives\n\nonly. It makes no difference that in these senatorial districts\n\nand counties a number of representatives are voted for by each\n\nelector at the same time. If the same electors at the same time\n\nare capable of choosing four or five representatives, they cannot\n\nbe incapable of choosing one. Pennsylvania is an additional\n\nexample. Some of her counties, which elect her State\n\nrepresentatives, are almost as large as her districts will be by\n\nwhich her federal representatives will be elected. The city of\n\nPhiladelphia is supposed to contain between fifty and sixty\n\nthousand souls. It will therefore form nearly two districts for\n\nthe choice of federal representatives. It forms, however, but\n\none county, in which every elector votes for each of its\n\nrepresentatives in the State legislature. And what may appear to\n\nbe still more directly to our purpose, the whole city actually\n\nelects a SINGLE MEMBER for the executive council. This is the\n\ncase in all the other counties of the State. Are not these facts\n\nthe most satisfactory proofs of the fallacy which has been\n\nemployed against the branch of the federal government under\n\nconsideration? Has it appeared on trial that the senators of New\n\nHampshire, Massachusetts, and New York, or the executive council\n\nof Pennsylvania, or the members of the Assembly in the two last\n\nStates, have betrayed any peculiar disposition to sacrifice the\n\nmany to the few, or are in any respect less worthy of their\n\nplaces than the representatives and magistrates appointed in\n\nother States by very small divisions of the people? But there are\n\ncases of a stronger complexion than any which I have yet quoted.\n\nOne branch of the legislature of Connecticut is so constituted\n\nthat each member of it is elected by the whole State. So is the\n\ngovernor of that State, of Massachusetts, and of this State, and\n\nthe president of New Hampshire. I leave every man to decide\n\nwhether the result of any one of these experiments can be said to\n\ncountenance a suspicion, that a diffusive mode of choosing\n\nrepresentatives of the people tends to elevate traitors and to\n\nundermine the public liberty.

        "content": "The Apportionment of Members Among the States\n\nFrom the New York Packet. Tuesday, February 12, 1788.\n\nTo the People of the State of New York:\n\nTHE next view which I shall take of the House of Representatives\n\nrelates to the appointment of its members to the several States\n\nwhich is to be determined by the same rule with that of direct\n\ntaxes.\n\nIt is not contended that the number of people in each\n\nState ought not to be the standard for regulating the proportion\n\nof those who are to represent the people of each State. The\n\nestablishment of the same rule for the appointment of taxes, will\n\nprobably be as little contested; though the rule itself in this\n\ncase, is by no means founded on the same principle. In the former\n\ncase, the rule is understood to refer to the personal rights of\n\nthe people, with which it has a natural and universal connection.\n\nIn the latter, it has reference to the proportion of wealth, of\n\nwhich it is in no case a precise measure, and in ordinary cases a\n\nvery unfit one. But notwithstanding the imperfection of the rule\n\nas applied to the relative wealth and contributions of the\n\nStates, it is evidently the least objectionable among the\n\npracticable rules, and had too recently obtained the general\n\nsanction of America, not to have found a ready preference with\n\nthe convention. All this is admitted, it will perhaps be said;\n\nbut does it follow, from an admission of numbers for the measure\n\nof representation, or of slaves combined with free citizens as a\n\nratio of taxation, that slaves ought to be included in the\n\nnumerical rule of representation? Slaves are considered as\n\nproperty, not as persons. They ought therefore to be comprehended\n\nin estimates of taxation which are founded on property, and to be\n\nexcluded from representation which is regulated by a census of\n\npersons. This is the objection, as I understand it, stated in its\n\nfull force. I shall be equally candid in stating the reasoning\n\nwhich may be offered on the opposite side. ``We subscribe to the\n\ndoctrine,'' might one of our Southern brethren observe, ``that\n\nrepresentation relates more immediately to persons, and taxation\n\nmore immediately to property, and we join in the application of\n\nthis distinction to the case of our slaves. But we must deny the\n\nfact, that slaves are considered merely as property, and in no\n\nrespect whatever as persons. The true state of the case is, that\n\nthey partake of both these qualities: being considered by our\n\nlaws, in some respects, as persons, and in other respects as\n\nproperty. In being compelled to labor, not for himself, but for\n\na master; in being vendible by one master to another master; and\n\nin being subject at all times to be restrained in his liberty and\n\nchastised in his body, by the capricious will of another, the\n\nslave may appear to be degraded from the human rank, and classed\n\nwith those irrational animals which fall under the legal\n\ndenomination of property. In being protected, on the other hand,\n\nin his life and in his limbs, against the violence of all\n\nothers, even the master of his labor and his liberty; and in\n\nbeing punishable himself for all violence committed against\n\nothers, the slave is no less evidently regarded by the law as a\n\nmember of the society, not as a part of the irrational creation;\n\nas a moral person, not as a mere article of property. The\n\nfederal Constitution, therefore, decides with great propriety on\n\nthe case of our slaves, when it views them in the mixed character\n\nof persons and of property. This is in fact their true\n\ncharacter. It is the character bestowed on them by the laws\n\nunder which they live; and it will not be denied, that these are\n\nthe proper criterion; because it is only under the pretext that\n\nthe laws have transformed the negroes into subjects of property,\n\nthat a place is disputed them in the computation of numbers; and\n\nit is admitted, that if the laws were to restore the rights which\n\nhave been taken away, the negroes could no longer be refused an\n\nequal share of representation with the other inhabitants. ``This\n\nquestion may be placed in another light. It is agreed on all\n\nsides, that numbers are the best scale of wealth and taxation, as\n\nthey are the only proper scale of representation. Would the\n\nconvention have been impartial or consistent, if they had\n\nrejected the slaves from the list of inhabitants, when the shares\n\nof representation were to be calculated, and inserted them on the\n\nlists when the tariff of contributions was to be adjusted? Could\n\nit be reasonably expected, that the Southern States would concur\n\nin a system, which considered their slaves in some degree as men,\n\nwhen burdens were to be imposed, but refused to consider them in\n\nthe same light, when advantages were to be conferred? Might not\n\nsome surprise also be expressed, that those who reproach the\n\nSouthern States with the barbarous policy of considering as\n\nproperty a part of their human brethren, should themselves\n\ncontend, that the government to which all the States are to be\n\nparties, ought to consider this unfortunate race more completely\n\nin the unnatural light of property, than the very laws of which\n\nthey complain? ``It may be replied, perhaps, that slaves are not\n\nincluded in the estimate of representatives in any of the States\n\npossessing them. They neither vote themselves nor increase the\n\nvotes of their masters. Upon what principle, then, ought they to\n\nbe taken into the federal estimate of representation? In\n\nrejecting them altogether, the Constitution would, in this\n\nrespect, have followed the very laws which have been appealed to\n\nas the proper guide. ``This objection is repelled by a single\n\nabservation. It is a fundamental principle of the proposed\n\nConstitution, that as the aggregate number of representatives\n\nallotted to the several States is to be determined by a federal\n\nrule, founded on the aggregate number of inhabitants, so the\n\nright of choosing this allotted number in each State is to be\n\nexercised by such part of the inhabitants as the State itself may\n\ndesignate. The qualifications on which the right of suffrage\n\ndepend are not, perhaps, the same in any two States. In some of\n\nthe States the difference is very material. In every State, a\n\ncertain proportion of inhabitants are deprived of this right by\n\nthe constitution of the State, who will be included in the census\n\nby which the federal Constitution apportions the representatives.\n\nIn this point of view the Southern States might retort the\n\ncomplaint, by insisting that the principle laid down by the\n\nconvention required that no regard should be had to the policy of\n\nparticular States towards their own inhabitants; and\n\nconsequently, that the slaves, as inhabitants, should have been\n\nadmitted into the census according to their full number, in like\n\nmanner with other inhabitants, who, by the policy of other\n\nStates, are not admitted to all the rights of citizens. A\n\nrigorous adherence, however, to this principle, is waived by\n\nthose who would be gainers by it. All that they ask is that\n\nequal moderation be shown on the other side. Let the case of the\n\nslaves be considered, as it is in truth, a peculiar one. Let the\n\ncompromising expedient of the Constitution be mutually adopted,\n\nwhich regards them as inhabitants, but as debased by servitude\n\nbelow the equal level of free inhabitants, which regards the\n\nSLAVE as divested of two fifths of the MAN. ``After all, may not\n\nanother ground be taken on which this article of the\n\nConstitution will admit of a still more ready defense? We have\n\nhitherto proceeded on the idea that representation related to\n\npersons only, and not at all to property. But is it a just idea?\n\nGovernment is instituted no less for protection of the property,\n\nthan of the persons, of individuals. The one as well as the\n\nother, therefore, may be considered as represented by those who\n\nare charged with the government. Upon this principle it is, that\n\nin several of the States, and particularly in the State of New\n\nYork, one branch of the government is intended more especially to\n\nbe the guardian of property, and is accordingly elected by that\n\npart of the society which is most interested in this object of\n\ngovernment. In the federal Constitution, this policy does not\n\nprevail. The rights of property are committed into the same hands\n\nwith the personal rights. Some attention ought, therefore, to be\n\npaid to property in the choice of those hands. ``For another\n\nreason, the votes allowed in the federal legislature to the\n\npeople of each State, ought to bear some proportion to the\n\ncomparative wealth of the States. States have not, like\n\nindividuals, an influence over each other, arising from superior\n\nadvantages of fortune. If the law allows an opulent citizen but a\n\nsingle vote in the choice of his representative, the respect and\n\nconsequence which he derives from his fortunate situation very\n\nfrequently guide the votes of others to the objects of his\n\nchoice; and through this imperceptible channel the rights of\n\nproperty are conveyed into the public representation. A State\n\npossesses no such influence over other States. It is not probable\n\nthat the richest State in the Confederacy will ever influence the\n\nchoice of a single representative in any other State. Nor will\n\nthe representatives of the larger and richer States possess any\n\nother advantage in the federal legislature, over the\n\nrepresentatives of other States, than what may result from their\n\nsuperior number alone. As far, therefore, as their superior\n\nwealth and weight may justly entitle them to any advantage, it\n\nought to be secured to them by a superior share of\n\nrepresentation. The new Constitution is, in this respect,\n\nmaterially different from the existing Confederation, as well as\n\nfrom that of the United Netherlands, and other similar\n\nconfederacies. In each of the latter, the efficacy of the\n\nfederal resolutions depends on the subsequent and voluntary\n\nresolutions of the states composing the union. Hence the states,\n\nthough possessing an equal vote in the public councils, have an\n\nunequal influence, corresponding with the unequal importance of\n\nthese subsequent and voluntary resolutions. Under the proposed\n\nConstitution, the federal acts will take effect without the\n\nnecessary intervention of the individual States. They will depend\n\nmerely on the majority of votes in the federal legislature, and\n\nconsequently each vote, whether proceeding from a larger or\n\nsmaller State, or a State more or less wealthy or powerful, will\n\nhave an equal weight and efficacy: in the same manner as the\n\nvotes individually given in a State legislature, by the\n\nrepresentatives of unequal counties or other districts, have\n\neach a precise equality of value and effect; or if there be any\n\ndifference in the case, it proceeds from the difference in the\n\npersonal character of the individual representative, rather than\n\nfrom any regard to the extent of the district from which he\n\ncomes. ''Such is the reasoning which an advocate for the\n\nSouthern interests might employ on this subject; and although it\n\nmay appear to be a little strained in some points, yet, on the\n\nwhole, I must confess that it fully reconciles me to the scale of\n\nrepresentation which the convention have established. In one\n\nrespect, the establishment of a common measure for representation\n\nand taxation will have a very salutary effect. As the accuracy\n\nof the census to be obtained by the Congress will necessarily\n\ndepend, in a considerable degree on the disposition, if not on\n\nthe co-operation, of the States, it is of great importance that\n\nthe States should feel as little bias as possible, to swell or to\n\nreduce the amount of their numbers. Were their share of\n\nrepresentation alone to be governed by this rule, they would have\n\nan interest in exaggerating their inhabitants. Were the rule to\n\ndecide their share of taxation alone, a contrary temptation would\n\nprevail. By extending the rule to both objects, the States will\n\nhave opposite interests, which will control and balance each\n\nother, and produce the requisite impartiality. PUBLIUS.",

        "content": "The Senate\n\nFor the Independent Journal.\n\nTo the People of the State of New York:\n\nHAVING examined the constitution of the House of\n\nRepresentatives, and answered such of the objections against it as\n\nseemed to merit notice, I enter next on the examination of the\n\nSenate.\n\nThe heads into which this member of the government may be\n\nconsidered are: I. The qualification of senators; II. The\n\nappointment of them by the State legislatures; III. The equality of\n\nrepresentation in the Senate; IV. The number of senators, and the\n\nterm for which they are to be elected; V. The powers vested in the\n\nSenate.\n\nI. The qualifications proposed for senators, as distinguished\n\nfrom those of representatives, consist in a more advanced age and a\n\nlonger period of citizenship. A senator must be thirty years of age\n\nat least; as a representative must be twenty-five. And the former\n\nmust have been a citizen nine years; as seven years are required\n\nfor the latter. The propriety of these distinctions is explained by\n\nthe nature of the senatorial trust, which, requiring greater extent\n\nof information and tability of character, requires at the same time\n\nthat the senator should have reached a period of life most likely to\n\nsupply these advantages; and which, participating immediately in\n\ntransactions with foreign nations, ought to be exercised by none who\n\nare not thoroughly weaned from the prepossessions and habits\n\nincident to foreign birth and education. The term of nine years\n\nappears to be a prudent mediocrity between a total exclusion of\n\nadopted citizens, whose merits and talents may claim a share in the\n\npublic confidence, and an indiscriminate and hasty admission of\n\nthem, which might create a channel for foreign influence on the\n\nnational councils.\n\nII. It is equally unnecessary to dilate on the appointment of\n\nsenators by the State legislatures. Among the various modes which\n\nmight have been devised for constituting this branch of the\n\ngovernment, that which has been proposed by the convention is\n\nprobably the most congenial with the public opinion. It is\n\nrecommended by the double advantage of favoring a select\n\nappointment, and of giving to the State governments such an agency\n\nin the formation of the federal government as must secure the\n\nauthority of the former, and may form a convenient link between the\n\ntwo systems.\n\nIII. The equality of representation in the Senate is another\n\npoint, which, being evidently the result of compromise between the\n\nopposite pretensions of the large and the small States, does not\n\ncall for much discussion. If indeed it be right, that among a\n\npeople thoroughly incorporated into one nation, every district ought\n\nto have a PROPORTIONAL share in the government, and that among\n\nindependent and sovereign States, bound together by a simple league,\n\nthe parties, however unequal in size, ought to have an EQUAL share\n\nin the common councils, it does not appear to be without some reason\n\nthat in a compound republic, partaking both of the national and\n\nfederal character, the government ought to be founded on a mixture\n\nof the principles of proportional and equal representation. But it\n\nis superfluous to try, by the standard of theory, a part of the\n\nConstitution which is allowed on all hands to be the result, not of\n\ntheory, but ``of a spirit of amity, and that mutual deference and\n\nconcession which the peculiarity of our political situation rendered\n\nindispensable.'' A common government, with powers equal to its\n\nobjects, is called for by the voice, and still more loudly by the\n\npolitical situation, of America. A government founded on principles\n\nmore consonant to the wishes of the larger States, is not likely to\n\nbe obtained from the smaller States. The only option, then, for the\n\nformer, lies between the proposed government and a government still\n\nmore objectionable. Under this alternative, the advice of prudence\n\nmust be to embrace the lesser evil; and, instead of indulging a\n\nfruitless anticipation of the possible mischiefs which may ensue, to\n\ncontemplate rather the advantageous consequences which may qualify\n\nthe sacrifice.\n\nIn this spirit it may be remarked, that the equal vote allowed\n\nto each State is at once a constitutional recognition of the portion\n\nof sovereignty remaining in the individual States, and an instrument\n\nfor preserving that residuary sovereignty. So far the equality\n\nought to be no less acceptable to the large than to the small\n\nStates; since they are not less solicitous to guard, by every\n\npossible expedient, against an improper consolidation of the States\n\ninto one simple republic.\n\nAnother advantage accruing from this ingredient in the\n\nconstitution of the Senate is, the additional impediment it must\n\nprove against improper acts of legislation. No law or resolution\n\ncan now be passed without the concurrence, first, of a majority of\n\nthe people, and then, of a majority of the States. It must be\n\nacknowledged that this complicated check on legislation may in some\n\ninstances be injurious as well as beneficial; and that the peculiar\n\ndefense which it involves in favor of the smaller States, would be\n\nmore rational, if any interests common to them, and distinct from\n\nthose of the other States, would otherwise be exposed to peculiar\n\ndanger. But as the larger States will always be able, by their\n\npower over the supplies, to defeat unreasonable exertions of this\n\nprerogative of the lesser States, and as the faculty and excess of\n\nlaw-making seem to be the diseases to which our governments are most\n\nliable, it is not impossible that this part of the Constitution may\n\nbe more convenient in practice than it appears to many in\n\ncontemplation.\n\nIV. The number of senators, and the duration of their\n\nappointment, come next to be considered. In order to form an\n\naccurate judgment on both of these points, it will be proper to\n\ninquire into the purposes which are to be answered by a senate; and\n\nin order to ascertain these, it will be necessary to review the\n\ninconveniences which a republic must suffer from the want of such an\n\ninstitution.\n\nFirst. It is a misfortune incident to republican\n\ngovernment, though in a less degree than to other governments, that\n\nthose who administer it may forget their obligations to their\n\nconstituents, and prove unfaithful to their important trust. In\n\nthis point of view, a senate, as a second branch of the legislative\n\nassembly, distinct from, and dividing the power with, a first, must\n\nbe in all cases a salutary check on the government. It doubles the\n\nsecurity to the people, by requiring the concurrence of two distinct\n\nbodies in schemes of usurpation or perfidy, where the ambition or\n\ncorruption of one would otherwise be sufficient. This is a\n\nprecaution founded on such clear principles, and now so well\n\nunderstood in the United States, that it would be more than\n\nsuperfluous to enlarge on it. I will barely remark, that as the\n\nimprobability of sinister combinations will be in proportion to the\n\ndissimilarity in the genius of the two bodies, it must be politic to\n\ndistinguish them from each other by every circumstance which will\n\nconsist with a due harmony in all proper measures, and with the\n\ngenuine principles of republican government.\n\nSecondly. The necessity of a senate is not less indicated\n\nby the propensity of all single and numerous assemblies to yield to\n\nthe impulse of sudden and violent passions, and to be seduced by\n\nfactious leaders into intemperate and pernicious resolutions.\n\nExamples on this subject might be cited without number; and from\n\nproceedings within the United States, as well as from the history of\n\nother nations. But a position that will not be contradicted, need\n\nnot be proved. All that need be remarked is, that a body which is\n\nto correct this infirmity ought itself to be free from it, and\n\nconsequently ought to be less numerous. It ought, moreover, to\n\npossess great firmness, and consequently ought to hold its authority\n\nby a tenure of considerable duration.\n\nThirdly. Another defect to be supplied by a senate lies in\n\na want of due acquaintance with the objects and principles of\n\nlegislation. It is not possible that an assembly of men called for\n\nthe most part from pursuits of a private nature, continued in\n\nappointment for a short time, and led by no permanent motive to\n\ndevote the intervals of public occupation to a study of the laws,\n\nthe affairs, and the comprehensive interests of their country,\n\nshould, if left wholly to themselves, escape a variety of important\n\nerrors in the exercise of their legislative trust. It may be\n\naffirmed, on the best grounds, that no small share of the present\n\nembarrassments of America is to be charged on the blunders of our\n\ngovernments; and that these have proceeded from the heads rather\n\nthan the hearts of most of the authors of them. What indeed are all\n\nthe repealing, explaining, and amending laws, which fill and\n\ndisgrace our voluminous codes, but so many monuments of deficient\n\nwisdom; so many impeachments exhibited by each succeeding against\n\neach preceding session; so many admonitions to the people, of the\n\nvalue of those aids which may be expected from a well-constituted\n\nsenate?\n\nA good government implies two things: first, fidelity to the\n\nobject of government, which is the happiness of the people;\n\nsecondly, a knowledge of the means by which that object can be best\n\nattained. Some governments are deficient in both these qualities;\n\nmost governments are deficient in the first. I scruple not to\n\nassert, that in American governments too little attention has been\n\npaid to the last. The federal Constitution avoids this error; and\n\nwhat merits particular notice, it provides for the last in a mode\n\nwhich increases the security for the first.\n\nFourthly. The mutability in the public councils arising\n\nfrom a rapid succession of new members, however qualified they may\n\nbe, points out, in the strongest manner, the necessity of some\n\nstable institution in the government. Every new election in the\n\nStates is found to change one half of the representatives. From\n\nthis change of men must proceed a change of opinions; and from a\n\nchange of opinions, a change of measures. But a continual change\n\neven of good measures is inconsistent with every rule of prudence\n\nand every prospect of success. The remark is verified in private\n\nlife, and becomes more just, as well as more important, in national\n\ntransactions.\n\nTo trace the mischievous effects of a mutable government would\n\nfill a volume. I will hint a few only, each of which will be\n\nperceived to be a source of innumerable others.\n\nIn the first place, it forfeits the respect and confidence of\n\nother nations, and all the advantages connected with national\n\ncharacter. An individual who is observed to be inconstant to his\n\nplans, or perhaps to carry on his affairs without any plan at all,\n\nis marked at once, by all prudent people, as a speedy victim to his\n\nown unsteadiness and folly. His more friendly neighbors may pity\n\nhim, but all will decline to connect their fortunes with his; and\n\nnot a few will seize the opportunity of making their fortunes out of\n\nhis. One nation is to another what one individual is to another;\n\nwith this melancholy distinction perhaps, that the former, with\n\nfewer of the benevolent emotions than the latter, are under fewer\n\nrestraints also from taking undue advantage from the indiscretions\n\nof each other. Every nation, consequently, whose affairs betray a\n\nwant of wisdom and stability, may calculate on every loss which can\n\nbe sustained from the more systematic policy of their wiser\n\nneighbors. But the best instruction on this subject is unhappily\n\nconveyed to America by the example of her own situation. She finds\n\nthat she is held in no respect by her friends; that she is the\n\nderision of her enemies; and that she is a prey to every nation\n\nwhich has an interest in speculating on her fluctuating councils and\n\nembarrassed affairs.\n\nThe internal effects of a mutable policy are still more\n\ncalamitous. It poisons the blessing of liberty itself. It will be\n\nof little avail to the people, that the laws are made by men of\n\ntheir own choice, if the laws be so voluminous that they cannot be\n\nread, or so incoherent that they cannot be understood; if they be\n\nrepealed or revised before they are promulgated, or undergo such\n\nincessant changes that no man, who knows what the law is to-day, can\n\nguess what it will be to-morrow. Law is defined to be a rule of\n\naction; but how can that be a rule, which is little known, and less\n\nfixed?\n\nAnother effect of public instability is the unreasonable\n\nadvantage it gives to the sagacious, the enterprising, and the\n\nmoneyed few over the industrious and uniformed mass of the people.\n\nEvery new regulation concerning commerce or revenue, or in any way\n\naffecting the value of the different species of property, presents a\n\nnew harvest to those who watch the change, and can trace its\n\nconsequences; a harvest, reared not by themselves, but by the toils\n\nand cares of the great body of their fellow-citizens. This is a\n\nstate of things in which it may be said with some truth that laws\n\nare made for the FEW, not for the MANY.\n\nIn another point of view, great injury results from an unstable\n\ngovernment. The want of confidence in the public councils damps\n\nevery useful undertaking, the success and profit of which may depend\n\non a continuance of existing arrangements.

        "content": "The Total Number of the House of Representatives\n\nFrom the New York Packet. Friday, February 15, 1788.\n\nTo the People of the State of New York:\n\nTHE number of which the House of Representatives is to consist,\n\nforms another and a very interesting point of view, under which\n\nthis branch of the federal legislature may be contemplated.\n\nScarce any article, indeed, in the whole Constitution seems to be\n\nrendered more worthy of attention, by the weight of character and\n\nthe apparent force of argument with which it has been assailed.\n\nThe charges exhibited against it are, first, that so small a\n\nnumber of representatives will be an unsafe depositary of the\n\npublic interests; secondly, that they will not possess a proper\n\nknowledge of the local circumstances of their numerous\n\nconstituents; thirdly, that they will be taken from that class of\n\ncitizens which will sympathize least with the feelings of the\n\nmass of the people, and be most likely to aim at a permanent\n\nelevation of the few on the depression of the many; fourthly,\n\nthat defective as the number will be in the first instance, it\n\nwill be more and more disproportionate, by the increase of the\n\npeople, and the obstacles which will prevent a correspondent\n\nincrease of the representatives. In general it may be remarked on\n\nthis subject, that no political problem is less susceptible of a\n\nprecise solution than that which relates to the number most\n\nconvenient for a representative legislature; nor is there any\n\npoint on which the policy of the several States is more at\n\nvariance, whether we compare their legislative assemblies\n\ndirectly with each other, or consider the proportions which they\n\nrespectively bear to the number of their constituents. Passing\n\nover the difference between the smallest and largest States, as\n\nDelaware, whose most numerous branch consists of twenty-one\n\nrepresentatives, and Massachusetts, where it amounts to between\n\nthree and four hundred, a very considerable difference is\n\nobservable among States nearly equal in population. The number of\n\nrepresentatives in Pennsylvania is not more than one fifth of\n\nthat in the State last mentioned. New York, whose population is\n\nto that of South Carolina as six to five, has little more than\n\none third of the number of representatives. As great a disparity\n\nprevails between the States of Georgia and Delaware or Rhode\n\nIsland. In Pennsylvania, the representatives do not bear a\n\ngreater proportion to their constituents than of one for every\n\nfour or five thousand. In Rhode Island, they bear a proportion of\n\nat least one for every thousand. And according to the\n\nconstitution of Georgia, the proportion may be carried to one to\n\nevery ten electors; and must unavoidably far exceed the\n\nproportion in any of the other States. Another general remark to\n\nbe made is, that the ratio between the representatives and the\n\npeople ought not to be the same where the latter are very\n\nnumerous as where they are very few. Were the representatives in\n\nVirginia to be regulated by the standard in Rhode Island, they\n\nwould, at this time, amount to between four and five hundred; and\n\ntwenty or thirty years hence, to a thousand. On the other hand,\n\nthe ratio of Pennsylvania, if applied to the State of Delaware,\n\nwould reduce the representative assembly of the latter to seven\n\nor eight members. Nothing can be more fallacious than to found\n\nour political calculations on arithmetical principles. Sixty or\n\nseventy men may be more properly trusted with a given degree of\n\npower than six or seven. But it does not follow that six or seven\n\nhundred would be proportionably a better depositary. And if we\n\ncarry on the supposition to six or seven thousand, the whole\n\nreasoning ought to be reversed. The truth is, that in all cases a\n\ncertain number at least seems to be necessary to secure the\n\nbenefits of free consultation and discussion, and to guard\n\nagainst too easy a combination for improper purposes; as, on the\n\nother hand, the number ought at most to be kept within a certain\n\nlimit, in order to avoid the confusion and intemperance of a\n\nmultitude. In all very numerous assemblies, of whatever character\n\ncomposed, passion never fails to wrest the sceptre from reason.\n\nHad every Athenian citizen been a Socrates, every Athenian\n\nassembly would still have been a mob.\n\nIt is necessary also to\n\nrecollect here the observations which were applied to the case of\n\nbiennial elections. For the same reason that the limited powers\n\nof the Congress, and the control of the State legislatures,\n\njustify less frequent elections than the public safely might\n\notherwise require, the members of the Congress need be less\n\nnumerous than if they possessed the whole power of legislation,\n\nand were under no other than the ordinary restraints of other\n\nlegislative bodies. With these general ideas in our mind, let us\n\nweigh the objections which have been stated against the number of\n\nmembers proposed for the House of Representatives. It is said, in\n\nthe first place, that so small a number cannot be safely trusted\n\nwith so much power. The number of which this branch of the\n\nlegislature is to consist, at the outset of the government, will\n\nbe sixtyfive. Within three years a census is to be taken, when\n\nthe number may be augmented to one for every thirty thousand\n\ninhabitants; and within every successive period of ten years the\n\ncensus is to be renewed, and augmentations may continue to be\n\nmade under the above limitation. It will not be thought an\n\nextravagant conjecture that the first census will, at the rate of\n\none for every thirty thousand, raise the number of\n\nrepresentatives to at least one hundred. Estimating the negroes\n\nin the proportion of three fifths, it can scarcely be doubted\n\nthat the population of the United States will by that time, if it\n\ndoes not already, amount to three millions. At the expiration of\n\ntwenty-five years, according to the computed rate of increase,\n\nthe number of representatives will amount to two hundred, and of\n\nfifty years, to four hundred. This is a number which, I presume,\n\nwill put an end to all fears arising from the smallness of the\n\nbody. I take for granted here what I shall, in answering the\n\nfourth objection, hereafter show, that the number of\n\nrepresentatives will be augmented from time to time in the\n\nmanner provided by the Constitution. On a contrary supposition, I\n\nshould admit the objection to have very great weight indeed. The\n\ntrue question to be decided then is, whether the smallness of the\n\nnumber, as a temporary regulation, be dangerous to the public\n\nliberty? Whether sixty-five members for a few years, and a\n\nhundred or two hundred for a few more, be a safe depositary for a\n\nlimited and well-guarded power of legislating for the United\n\nStates? I must own that I could not give a negative answer to\n\nthis question, without first obliterating every impression which\n\nI have received with regard to the present genius of the people\n\nof America, the spirit which actuates the State legislatures, and\n\nthe principles which are incorporated with the political\n\ncharacter of every class of citizens I am unable to conceive that\n\nthe people of America, in their present temper, or under any\n\ncircumstances which can speedily happen, will choose, and every\n\nsecond year repeat the choice of, sixty-five or a hundred men who\n\nwould be disposed to form and pursue a scheme of tyranny or\n\ntreachery. I am unable to conceive that the State legislatures,\n\nwhich must feel so many motives to watch, and which possess so\n\nmany means of counteracting, the federal legislature, would fail\n\neither to detect or to defeat a conspiracy of the latter against\n\nthe liberties of their common constituents. I am equally unable\n\nto conceive that there are at this time, or can be in any short\n\ntime, in the United States, any sixty-five or a hundred men\n\ncapable of recommending themselves to the choice of the people at\n\nlarge, who would either desire or dare, within the short space of\n\ntwo years, to betray the solemn trust committed to them. What\n\nchange of circumstances, time, and a fuller population of our\n\ncountry may produce, requires a prophetic spirit to declare,\n\nwhich makes no part of my pretensions. But judging from the\n\ncircumstances now before us, and from the probable state of them\n\nwithin a moderate period of time, I must pronounce that the\n\nliberties of America cannot be unsafe in the number of hands\n\nproposed by the federal Constitution. From what quarter can the\n\ndanger proceed? Are we afraid of foreign gold? If foreign gold\n\ncould so easily corrupt our federal rulers and enable them to\n\nensnare and betray their constituents, how has it happened that\n\nwe are at this time a free and independent nation? The Congress\n\nwhich conducted us through the Revolution was a less numerous\n\nbody than their successors will be; they were not chosen by, nor\n\nresponsible to, their fellowcitizens at large; though appointed\n\nfrom year to year, and recallable at pleasure, they were\n\ngenerally continued for three years, and prior to the\n\nratification of the federal articles, for a still longer term.\n\nThey held their consultations always under the veil of secrecy;\n\nthey had the sole transaction of our affairs with foreign\n\nnations; through the whole course of the war they had the fate of\n\ntheir country more in their hands than it is to be hoped will\n\never be the case with our future representatives; and from the\n\ngreatness of the prize at stake, and the eagerness of the party\n\nwhich lost it, it may well be supposed that the use of other\n\nmeans than force would not have been scrupled. Yet we know by\n\nhappy experience that the public trust was not betrayed; nor has\n\nthe purity of our public councils in this particular ever\n\nsuffered, even from the whispers of calumny. Is the danger\n\napprehended from the other branches of the federal government?\n\nBut where are the means to be found by the President, or the\n\nSenate, or both? Their emoluments of office, it is to be\n\npresumed, will not, and without a previous corruption of the\n\nHouse of Representatives cannot, more than suffice for very\n\ndifferent purposes; their private fortunes, as they must allbe\n\nAmerican citizens, cannot possibly be sources of danger. The\n\nonly means, then, which they can possess, will be in the\n\ndispensation of appointments. Is it here that suspicion rests\n\nher charge? Sometimes we are told that this fund of corruption\n\nis to be exhausted by the President in subduing the virtue of the\n\nSenate. Now, the fidelity of the other House is to be the\n\nvictim. The improbability of such a mercenary and perfidious\n\ncombination of the several members of government, standing on as\n\ndifferent foundations as republican principles will well admit,\n\nand at the same time accountable to the society over which they\n\nare placed, ought alone to quiet this apprehension. But,\n\nfortunately, the Constitution has provided a still further\n\nsafeguard. The members of the Congress are rendered ineligible\n\nto any civil offices that may be created, or of which the\n\nemoluments may be increased, during the term of their election.\n\nNo offices therefore can be dealt out to the existing members but\n\nsuch as may become vacant by ordinary casualties: and to suppose\n\nthat these would be sufficient to purchase the guardians of the\n\npeople, selected by the people themselves, is to renounce every\n\nrule by which events ought to be calculated, and to substitute an\n\nindiscriminate and unbounded jealousy, with which all reasoning\n\nmust be vain. The sincere friends of liberty, who give\n\nthemselves up to the extravagancies of this passion, are not\n\naware of the injury they do their own cause. As there is a\n\ndegree of depravity in mankind which requires a certain degree of\n\ncircumspection and distrust, so there are other qualities in\n\nhuman nature which justify a certain portion of esteem and\n\nconfidence. Republican government presupposes the existence of\n\nthese qualities in a higher degree than any other form. Were the\n\npictures which have been drawn by the political jealousy of some\n\namong us faithful likenesses of the human character, the\n\ninference would be, that there is not sufficient virtue among men\n\nfor self-government; and that nothing less than the chains of\n\ndespotism can restrain them from destroying and devouring one\n\nanother.

        "content": "Periodical Appeals to the People Considered\n\nFrom the New York Packet. Tuesday, February 5, 1788.\n\nTo the People of the State of New York:\n\nIT MAY be contended, perhaps, that instead of OCCASIONAL appeals\n\nto the people, which are liable to the objections urged against\n\nthem, PERIODICAL appeals are the proper and adequate means of\n\nPREVENTING AND CORRECTING INFRACTIONS OF THE CONSTITUTION. It\n\nwill be attended to, that in the examination of these expedients,\n\nI confine myself to their aptitude for ENFORCING the\n\nConstitution, by keeping the several departments of power within\n\ntheir due bounds, without particularly considering them as\n\nprovisions for ALTERING the Constitution itself. In the first\n\nview, appeals to the people at fixed periods appear to be nearly\n\nas ineligible as appeals on particular occasions as they emerge.\n\nIf the periods be separated by short intervals, the measures to\n\nbe reviewed and rectified will have been of recent date, and will\n\nbe connected with all the circumstances which tend to vitiate and\n\npervert the result of occasional revisions. If the periods be\n\ndistant from each other, the same remark will be applicable to\n\nall recent measures; and in proportion as the remoteness of the\n\nothers may favor a dispassionate review of them, this advantage\n\nis inseparable from inconveniences which seem to counterbalance\n\nit. In the first place, a distant prospect of public censure\n\nwould be a very feeble restraint on power from those excesses to\n\nwhich it might be urged by the force of present motives. Is it to\n\nbe imagined that a legislative assembly, consisting of a hundred\n\nor two hundred members, eagerly bent on some favorite object, and\n\nbreaking through the restraints of the Constitution in pursuit of\n\nit, would be arrested in their career, by considerations drawn\n\nfrom a censorial revision of their conduct at the future distance\n\nof ten, fifteen, or twenty years? In the next place, the abuses\n\nwould often have completed their mischievous effects before the\n\nremedial provision would be applied. And in the last place, where\n\nthis might not be the case, they would be of long standing, would\n\nhave taken deep root, and would not easily be extirpated. The\n\nscheme of revising the constitution, in order to correct recent\n\nbreaches of it, as well as for other purposes, has been actually\n\ntried in one of the States. One of the objects of the Council of\n\nCensors which met in Pennsylvania in 1783 and 1784, was, as we\n\nhave seen, to inquire, ``whether the constitution had been\n\nviolated, and whether the legislative and executive departments\n\nhad encroached upon each other. '' This important and novel\n\nexperiment in politics merits, in several points of view, very\n\nparticular attention. In some of them it may, perhaps, as a\n\nsingle experiment, made under circumstances somewhat peculiar, be\n\nthought to be not absolutely conclusive. But as applied to the\n\ncase under consideration, it involves some facts, which I venture\n\nto remark, as a complete and satisfactory illustration of the\n\nreasoning which I have employed. First. It appears, from the\n\nnames of the gentlemen who composed the council, that some, at\n\nleast, of its most active members had also been active and\n\nleading characters in the parties which pre-existed in the State.\n\nSecondly. It appears that the same active and leading members of\n\nthe council had been active and influential members of the\n\nlegislative and executive branches, within the period to be\n\nreviewed; and even patrons or opponents of the very measures to\n\nbe thus brought to the test of the constitution. Two of the\n\nmembers had been vice-presidents of the State, and several other\n\nmembers of the executive council, within the seven preceding\n\nyears. One of them had been speaker, and a number of others\n\ndistinguished members, of the legislative assembly within the\n\nsame period. Thirdly. Every page of their proceedings witnesses\n\nthe effect of all these circumstances on the temper of their\n\ndeliberations. Throughout the continuance of the council, it was\n\nsplit into two fixed and violent parties. The fact is\n\nacknowledged and lamented by themselves. Had this not been the\n\ncase, the face of their proceedings exhibits a proof equally\n\nsatisfactory. In all questions, however unimportant in\n\nthemselves, or unconnected with each other, the same names stand\n\ninvariably contrasted on the opposite columns. Every unbiased\n\nobserver may infer, without danger of mistake, and at the same\n\ntime without meaning to reflect on either party, or any\n\nindividuals of either party, that, unfortunately, PASSION, not\n\nREASON, must have presided over their decisions. When men\n\nexercise their reason coolly and freely on a variety of distinct\n\nquestions, they inevitably fall into different opinions on some\n\nof them. When they are governed by a common passion, their\n\nopinions, if they are so to be called, will be the same.\n\nFourthly. It is at least problematical, whether the decisions of\n\nthis body do not, in several instances, misconstrue the limits\n\nprescribed for the legislative and executive departments, instead\n\nof reducing and limiting them within their constitutional places.\n\nFifthly. I have never understood that the decisions of the\n\ncouncil on constitutional questions, whether rightly or\n\nerroneously formed, have had any effect in varying the practice\n\nfounded on legislative constructions. It even appears, if I\n\nmistake not, that in one instance the contemporary legislature\n\ndenied the constructions of the council, and actually prevailed\n\nin the contest. This censorial body, therefore, proves at the\n\nsame time, by its researches, the existence of the disease, and\n\nby its example, the inefficacy of the remedy. This conclusion\n\ncannot be invalidated by alleging that the State in which the\n\nexperiment was made was at that crisis, and had been for a long\n\ntime before, violently heated and distracted by the rage of\n\nparty. Is it to be presumed, that at any future septennial epoch\n\nthe same State will be free from parties? Is it to be presumed\n\nthat any other State, at the same or any other given period, will\n\nbe exempt from them? Such an event ought to be neither presumed\n\nnor desired; because an extinction of parties necessarily implies\n\neither a universal alarm for the public safety, or an absolute\n\nextinction of liberty. Were the precaution taken of excluding\n\nfrom the assemblies elected by the people, to revise the\n\npreceding administration of the government, all persons who\n\nshould have been concerned with the government within the given\n\nperiod, the difficulties would not be obviated. The important\n\ntask would probably devolve on men, who, with inferior\n\ncapacities, would in other respects be little better qualified.\n\nAlthough they might not have been personally concerned in the\n\nadministration, and therefore not immediately agents in the\n\nmeasures to be examined, they would probably have been involved\n\nin the parties connected with these measures, and have been\n\nelected under their auspices.

        "content": "The Structure of the Government Must Furnish the Proper Checks\n\nand Balances Between the Different Departments\n\nFrom the New York Packet. Friday, February 8, 1788.\n\nTo the People of the State of New York:\n\nTO WHAT expedient, then, shall we finally resort, for maintaining\n\nin practice the necessary partition of power among the several\n\ndepartments, as laid down in the Constitution? The only answer\n\nthat can be given is, that as all these exterior provisions are\n\nfound to be inadequate, the defect must be supplied, by so\n\ncontriving the interior structure of the government as that its\n\nseveral constituent parts may, by their mutual relations, be the\n\nmeans of keeping each other in their proper places. Without\n\npresuming to undertake a full development of this important idea,\n\nI will hazard a few general observations, which may perhaps place\n\nit in a clearer light, and enable us to form a more correct\n\njudgment of the principles and structure of the government\n\nplanned by the convention. In order to lay a due foundation for\n\nthat separate and distinct exercise of the different powers of\n\ngovernment, which to a certain extent is admitted on all hands to\n\nbe essential to the preservation of liberty, it is evident that\n\neach department should have a will of its own; and consequently\n\nshould be so constituted that the members of each should have as\n\nlittle agency as possible in the appointment of the members of\n\nthe others. Were this principle rigorously adhered to, it would\n\nrequire that all the appointments for the supreme executive,\n\nlegislative, and judiciary magistracies should be drawn from the\n\nsame fountain of authority, the people, through channels having\n\nno communication whatever with one another. Perhaps such a plan\n\nof constructing the several departments would be less difficult\n\nin practice than it may in contemplation appear. Some\n\ndifficulties, however, and some additional expense would attend\n\nthe execution of it. Some deviations, therefore, from the\n\nprinciple must be admitted. In the constitution of the judiciary\n\ndepartment in particular, it might be inexpedient to insist\n\nrigorously on the principle: first, because peculiar\n\nqualifications being essential in the members, the primary\n\nconsideration ought to be to select that mode of choice which\n\nbest secures these qualifications; secondly, because the\n\npermanent tenure by which the appointments are held in that\n\ndepartment, must soon destroy all sense of dependence on the\n\nauthority conferring them. It is equally evident, that the\n\nmembers of each department should be as little dependent as\n\npossible on those of the others, for the emoluments annexed to\n\ntheir offices. Were the executive magistrate, or the judges, not\n\nindependent of the legislature in this particular, their\n\nindependence in every other would be merely nominal. But the\n\ngreat security against a gradual concentration of the several\n\npowers in the same department, consists in giving to those who\n\nadminister each department the necessary constitutional means and\n\npersonal motives to resist encroachments of the others. The\n\nprovision for defense must in this, as in all other cases, be\n\nmade commensurate to the danger of attack. Ambition must be made\n\nto counteract ambition. The interest of the man must be\n\nconnected with the constitutional rights of the place. It may be\n\na reflection on human nature, that such devices should be\n\nnecessary to control the abuses of government. But what is\n\ngovernment itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human\n\nnature? If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If\n\nangels were to govern men, neither external nor internal\n\ncontrols on government would be necessary. In framing a\n\ngovernment which is to be administered by men over men, the great\n\ndifficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to\n\ncontrol the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control\n\nitself. A dependence on the people is, no doubt, the primary\n\ncontrol on the government; but experience has taught mankind the\n\nnecessity of auxiliary precautions. This policy of supplying, by\n\nopposite and rival interests, the defect of better motives, might\n\nbe traced through the whole system of human affairs, private as\n\nwell as public. We see it particularly displayed in all the\n\nsubordinate distributions of power, where the constant aim is to\n\ndivide and arrange the several offices in such a manner as that\n\neach may be a check on the other that the private interest of\n\nevery individual may be a sentinel over the public rights. These\n\ninventions of prudence cannot be less requisite in the\n\ndistribution of the supreme powers of the State. But it is not\n\npossible to give to each department an equal power of\n\nself-defense. In republican government, the legislative\n\nauthority necessarily predominates. The remedy for this\n\ninconveniency is to divide the legislature into different\n\nbranches; and to render them, by different modes of election and\n\ndifferent principles of action, as little connected with each\n\nother as the nature of their common functions and their common\n\ndependence on the society will admit. It may even be necessary\n\nto guard against dangerous encroachments by still further\n\nprecautions. As the weight of the legislative authority requires\n\nthat it should be thus divided, the weakness of the executive may\n\nrequire, on the other hand, that it should be fortified. An\n\nabsolute negative on the legislature appears, at first view, to\n\nbe the natural defense with which the executive magistrate should\n\nbe armed. But perhaps it would be neither altogether safe nor\n\nalone sufficient. On ordinary occasions it might not be exerted\n\nwith the requisite firmness, and on extraordinary occasions it\n\nmight be perfidiously abused. May not this defect of an absolute\n\nnegative be supplied by some qualified connection between this\n\nweaker department and the weaker branch of the stronger\n\ndepartment, by which the latter may be led to support the\n\nconstitutional rights of the former, without being too much\n\ndetached from the rights of its own department? If the principles\n\non which these observations are founded be just, as I persuade\n\nmyself they are, and they be applied as a criterion to the\n\nseveral State constitutions, and to the federal Constitution it\n\nwill be found that if the latter does not perfectly correspond\n\nwith them, the former are infinitely less able to bear such a\n\ntest. There are, moreover, two considerations particularly\n\napplicable to the federal system of America, which place that\n\nsystem in a very interesting point of view. First. In a single\n\nrepublic, all the power surrendered by the people is submitted to\n\nthe administration of a single government; and the usurpations\n\nare guarded against by a division of the government into distinct\n\nand separate departments. In the compound republic of America,\n\nthe power surrendered by the people is first divided between two\n\ndistinct governments, and then the portion allotted to each\n\nsubdivided among distinct and separate departments. Hence a\n\ndouble security arises to the rights of the people. The different\n\ngovernments will control each other, at the same time that each\n\nwill be controlled by itself. Second. It is of great importance\n\nin a republic not only to guard the society against the\n\noppression of its rulers, but to guard one part of the society\n\nagainst the injustice of the other part. Different interests\n\nnecessarily exist in different classes of citizens. If a\n\nmajority be united by a common interest, the rights of the\n\nminority will be insecure. There are but two methods of\n\nproviding against this evil: the one by creating a will in the\n\ncommunity independent of the majority that is, of the society\n\nitself; the other, by comprehending in the society so many\n\nseparate descriptions of citizens as will render an unjust\n\ncombination of a majority of the whole very improbable, if not\n\nimpracticable. The first method prevails in all governments\n\npossessing an hereditary or self-appointed authority. This, at\n\nbest, is but a precarious security; because a power independent\n\nof the society may as well espouse the unjust views of the major,\n\nas the rightful interests of the minor party, and may possibly be\n\nturned against both parties. The second method will be\n\nexemplified in the federal republic of the United States. Whilst\n\nall authority in it will be derived from and dependent on the\n\nsociety, the society itself will be broken into so many parts,\n\ninterests, and classes of citizens, that the rights of\n\nindividuals, or of the minority, will be in little danger from\n\ninterested combinations of the majority. In a free government\n\nthe security for civil rights must be the same as that for\n\nreligious rights. It consists in the one case in the\n\nmultiplicity of interests, and in the other in the multiplicity\n\nof sects. The degree of security in both cases will depend on\n\nthe number of interests and sects; and this may be presumed to\n\ndepend on the extent of country and number of people comprehended\n\nunder the same government. This view of the subject must\n\nparticularly recommend a proper federal system to all the sincere\n\nand considerate friends of republican government, since it shows\n\nthat in exact proportion as the territory of the Union may be\n\nformed into more circumscribed Confederacies, or States\n\noppressive combinations of a majority will be facilitated: the\n\nbest security, under the republican forms, for the rights of\n\nevery class of citizens, will be diminished: and consequently the\n\nstability and independence of some member of the government, the\n\nonly other security, must be proportionately increased. Justice\n\nis the end of government. It is the end of civil society. It\n\never has been and ever will be pursued until it be obtained, or\n\nuntil liberty be lost in the pursuit. In a society under the\n\nforms of which the stronger faction can readily unite and oppress\n\nthe weaker, anarchy may as truly be said to reign as in a state\n\nof nature, where the weaker individual is not secured against the\n\nviolence of the stronger; and as, in the latter state, even the\n\nstronger individuals are prompted, by the uncertainty of their\n\ncondition, to submit to a government which may protect the weak\n\nas well as themselves; so, in the former state, will the more\n\npowerful factions or parties be gradnally induced, by a like\n\nmotive, to wish for a government which will protect all parties,\n\nthe weaker as well as the more powerful. It can be little\n\ndoubted that if the State of Rhode Island was separated from the\n\nConfederacy and left to itself, the insecurity of rights under\n\nthe popular form of government within such narrow limits would be\n\ndisplayed by such reiterated oppressions of factious majorities\n\nthat some power altogether independent of the people would soon\n\nbe called for by the voice of the very factions whose misrule had\n\nproved the necessity of it. In the extended republic of the\n\nUnited States, and among the great variety of interests, parties,\n\nand sects which it embraces, a coalition of a majority of the\n\nwhole society could seldom take place on any other principles\n\nthan those of justice and the general good; whilst there being\n\nthus less danger to a minor from the will of a major party, there\n\nmust be less pretext, also, to provide for the security of the\n\nformer, by introducing into the government a will not dependent\n\non the latter, or, in other words, a will independent of the\n\nsociety itself. It is no less certain than it is important,\n\nnotwithstanding the contrary opinions which have been\n\nentertained, that the larger the society, provided it lie within\n\na practical sphere, the more duly capable it will be of\n\nself-government. And happily for the REPUBLICAN CAUSE, the\n\npracticable sphere may be carried to a very great extent, by a\n\njudicious modification and mixture of the FEDERAL PRINCIPLE.\n\nPUBLIUS.",

        "content": "Method of Guarding Against the Encroachments of Any One\n\nDepartment of Government by Appealing to the People Through a\n\nConvention\n\nFrom the New York Packet. Tuesday, February 5, 1788.\n\nTo the People of the State of New York:\n\nTHE author of the ``Notes on the State of Virginia,'' quoted in\n\nthe last paper, has subjoined to that valuable work the draught\n\nof a constitution, which had been prepared in order to be laid\n\nbefore a convention, expected to be called in 1783, by the\n\nlegislature, for the establishment of a constitution for that\n\ncommonwealth. The plan, like every thing from the same pen, marks\n\na turn of thinking, original, comprehensive, and accurate; and is\n\nthe more worthy of attention as it equally displays a fervent\n\nattachment to republican government and an enlightened view of\n\nthe dangerous propensities against which it ought to be guarded.\n\nOne of the precautions which he proposes, and on which he appears\n\nultimately to rely as a palladium to the weaker departments of\n\npower against the invasions of the stronger, is perhaps\n\naltogether his own, and as it immediately relates to the subject\n\nof our present inquiry, ought not to be overlooked. His\n\nproposition is, ``that whenever any two of the three branches of\n\ngovernment shall concur in opinion, each by the voices of two\n\nthirds of their whole number, that a convention is necessary for\n\naltering the constitution, or CORRECTING BREACHES OF IT, a\n\nconvention shall be called for the purpose. ''As the people are\n\nthe only legitimate fountain of power, and it is from them that\n\nthe constitutional charter, under which the several branches of\n\ngovernment hold their power, is derived, it seems strictly\n\nconsonant to the republican theory, to recur to the same original\n\nauthority, not only whenever it may be necessary to enlarge,\n\ndiminish, or new-model the powers of the government, but also\n\nwhenever any one of the departments may commit encroachments on\n\nthe chartered authorities of the others. The several departments\n\nbeing perfectly co-ordinate by the terms of their common\n\ncommission, none of them, it is evident, can pretend to an\n\nexclusive or superior right of settling the boundaries between\n\ntheir respective powers; and how are the encroachments of the\n\nstronger to be prevented, or the wrongs of the weaker to be\n\nredressed, without an appeal to the people themselves, who, as\n\nthe grantors of the commissions, can alone declare its true\n\nmeaning, and enforce its observance? There is certainly great\n\nforce in this reasoning, and it must be allowed to prove that a\n\nconstitutional road to the decision of the people ought to be\n\nmarked out and kept open, for certain great and extraordinary\n\noccasions. But there appear to be insuperable objections against\n\nthe proposed recurrence to the people, as a provision in all\n\ncases for keeping the several departments of power within their\n\nconstitutional limits. In the first place, the provision does not\n\nreach the case of a combination of two of the departments against\n\nthe third. If the legislative authority, which possesses so many\n\nmeans of operating on the motives of the other departments,\n\nshould be able to gain to its interest either of the others, or\n\neven one third of its members, the remaining department could\n\nderive no advantage from its remedial provision. I do not dwell,\n\nhowever, on this objection, because it may be thought to be\n\nrather against the modification of the principle, than against\n\nthe principle itself. In the next place, it may be considered as\n\nan objection inherent in the principle, that as every appeal to\n\nthe people would carry an implication of some defect in the\n\ngovernment, frequent appeals would, in a great measure, deprive\n\nthe government of that veneration which time bestows on every\n\nthing, and without which perhaps the wisest and freest\n\ngovernments would not possess the requisite stability. If it be\n\ntrue that all governments rest on opinion, it is no less true\n\nthat the strength of opinion in each individual, and its\n\npractical influence on his conduct, depend much on the number\n\nwhich he supposes to have entertained the same opinion. The\n\nreason of man, like man himself, is timid and cautious when left\n\nalone, and acquires firmness and confidence in proportion to the\n\nnumber with which it is associated. When the examples which\n\nfortify opinion are ANCIENT as well as NUMEROUS, they are known\n\nto have a double effect. In a nation of philosophers, this\n\nconsideration ought to be disregarded. A reverence for the laws\n\nwould be sufficiently inculcated by the voice of an enlightened\n\nreason. But a nation of philosophers is as little to be expected\n\nas the philosophical race of kings wished for by Plato. And in\n\nevery other nation, the most rational government will not find it\n\na superfluous advantage to have the prejudices of the community\n\non its side. The danger of disturbing the public tranquillity by\n\ninteresting too strongly the public passions, is a still more\n\nserious objection against a frequent reference of constitutional\n\nquestions to the decision of the whole society. Notwithstanding\n\nthe success which has attended the revisions of our established\n\nforms of government, and which does so much honor to the virtue\n\nand intelligence of the people of America, it must be confessed\n\nthat the experiments are of too ticklish a nature to be\n\nunnecessarily multiplied. We are to recollect that all the\n\nexisting constitutions were formed in the midst of a danger which\n\nrepressed the passions most unfriendly to order and concord; of\n\nan enthusiastic confidence of the people in their patriotic\n\nleaders, which stifled the ordinary diversity of opinions on\n\ngreat national questions; of a universal ardor for new and\n\nopposite forms, produced by a universal resentment and\n\nindignation against the ancient government; and whilst no spirit\n\nof party connected with the changes to be made, or the abuses to\n\nbe reformed, could mingle its leaven in the operation. The future\n\nsituations in which we must expect to be usually placed, do not\n\npresent any equivalent security against the danger which is\n\napprehended. But the greatest objection of all is, that the\n\ndecisions which would probably result from such appeals would not\n\nanswer the purpose of maintaining the constitutional equilibrium\n\nof the government. We have seen that the tendency of republican\n\ngovernments is to an aggrandizement of the legislative at the\n\nexpense of the other departments. The appeals to the people,\n\ntherefore, would usually be made by the executive and judiciary\n\ndepartments. But whether made by one side or the other, would\n\neach side enjoy equal advantages on the trial? Let us view their\n\ndifferent situations. The members of the executive and judiciary\n\ndepartments are few in number, and can be personally known to a\n\nsmall part only of the people. The latter, by the mode of their\n\nappointment, as well as by the nature and permanency of it, are\n\ntoo far removed from the people to share much in their\n\nprepossessions. The former are generally the objects of jealousy,\n\nand their administration is always liable to be discolored and\n\nrendered unpopular. The members of the legislative department, on\n\nthe other hand, are numberous. They are distributed and dwell\n\namong the people at large. Their connections of blood, of\n\nfriendship, and of acquaintance embrace a great proportion of the\n\nmost influential part of the society. The nature of their public\n\ntrust implies a personal influence among the people, and that\n\nthey are more immediately the confidential guardians of the\n\nrights and liberties of the people. With these advantages, it can\n\nhardly be supposed that the adverse party would have an equal\n\nchance for a favorable issue. But the legislative party would not\n\nonly be able to plead their cause most successfully with the\n\npeople. They would probably be constituted themselves the judges.\n\nThe same influence which had gained them an election into the\n\nlegislature, would gain them a seat in the convention. If this\n\nshould not be the case with all, it would probably be the case\n\nwith many, and pretty certainly with those leading characters, on\n\nwhom every thing depends in such bodies. The convention, in\n\nshort, would be composed chiefly of men who had been, who\n\nactually were, or who expected to be, members of the department\n\nwhose conduct was arraigned. They would consequently be parties\n\nto the very question to be decided by them. It might, however,\n\nsometimes happen, that appeals would be made under circumstances\n\nless adverse to the executive and judiciary departments. The\n\nusurpations of the legislature might be so flagrant and so\n\nsudden, as to admit of no specious coloring. A strong party\n\namong themselves might take side with the other branches. The\n\nexecutive power might be in the hands of a peculiar favorite of\n\nthe people. In such a posture of things, the public decision\n\nmight be less swayed by prepossessions in favor of the\n\nlegislative party. But still it could never be expected to turn\n\non the true merits of the question. It would inevitably be\n\nconnected with the spirit of pre-existing parties, or of parties\n\nspringing out of the question itself. It would be connected with\n\npersons of distinguished character and extensive influence in the\n\ncommunity. It would be pronounced by the very men who had been\n\nagents in, or opponents of, the measures to which the decision\n\nwould relate. The PASSIONS, therefore, not the REASON, of the\n\npublic would sit in judgment. But it is the reason, alone, of the\n\npublic, that ought to control and regulate the government. The\n\npassions ought to be controlled and regulated by the government.\n\nWe found in the last paper, that mere declarations in the written\n\nconstitution are not sufficient to restrain the several\n\ndepartments within their legal rights. It appears in this, that\n\noccasional appeals to the people would be neither a proper nor an\n\neffectual provision for that purpose. How far the provisions of a\n\ndifferent nature contained in the plan above quoted might be\n\nadequate, I do not examine. Some of them are unquestionably\n\nfounded on sound political principles, and all of them are framed\n\nwith singular ingenuity and precision. PUBLIUS.",
