# Introduction 


Following the American Revolutionary war in 1787 when the United States was only a loose collection of states, three of the founders, namely Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay published a series of 85 essays known as Federalist Paper where they argue for uniting the states under a centralized government based on representative democracy and ractifying the United States Constitution.

However, 11 of these papers have disputed authorship and remain a topic of debate. In this project, I utilize a language model that Microsoft developed called Deberta to determine the autorship on the disputed papers.
