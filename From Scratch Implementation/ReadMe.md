# Implementation of machine learning algorithms

1. [Neural Network: neural_network.ipynb](neural_network.ipynb) - Define and implement a **deep neural network** from scratch in PyTorch while training it to classify handwritten digits (i.e. multi-class classification).

2. [Logistic Regression: logistic_regression](logistic_regression) - Build a sentiment analysis classifier to classify tweets using logistic regression.
